1 Preface
*********

This document demonstrates and explains the GnuTLS library API.  A
brief introduction to the protocols and the technology involved is also
included so that an application programmer can better understand the
GnuTLS purpose and actual offerings.  Even if GnuTLS is a typical
library software, it operates over several security and cryptographic
protocols which require the programmer to make careful and correct
usage of them. Otherwise it is likely to only obtain a false sense of
security.  The term of security is very broad even if restricted to
computer software, and cannot be confined to a single cryptographic
library.  For that reason, do not consider any program secure just
because it uses GnuTLS; there are several ways to compromise a program
or a communication line and GnuTLS only helps with some of them.

Although this document tries to be self contained, basic network
programming and public key infrastructure (PKI) knowledge is assumed in
most of it. A good introduction to networking can be found in
[`STEVENS'] , to public key infrastructure in [`GUTPKI']

and to security engineering in [`ANDERSON'] .

Updated versions of the GnuTLS software and this document will be
available from `http://www.gnutls.org/' and
`http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/'.

2 The Library
*************

In brief GnuTLS can be described as a library which offers an API to
access secure communication protocols. These protocols provide privacy
over insecure lines, and were designed to prevent eavesdropping,
tampering, or message forgery.

Technically GnuTLS is a portable ANSI C based library which implements
the protocols ranging from SSL 3.0 to TLS 1.2 (see *note Introduction
to TLS::, for a detailed description of the protocols), accompanied
with the required framework for authentication and public key
infrastructure.  Important features of the GnuTLS library include:

   * Support for TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 protocols.

   * Support for Datagram TLS 1.0.

   * Support for both X.509 and OpenPGP certificates.

   * Support for handling and verification of certificates.

   * Support for password authentication using TLS-SRP.

   * Support for keyed authentication using TLS-PSK.

   * Support for PKCS #11 tokens and smart-cards.


The GnuTLS library consists of three independent parts, namely the "TLS
protocol part", the "Certificate part", and the "Cryptographic
back-end" part.  The "TLS protocol part" is the actual protocol
implementation, and is entirely implemented within the GnuTLS library.
The "Certificate part" consists of the certificate parsing, and
verification functions and it uses functionality from the libtasn1(1)
library.  The "Cryptographic back-end" is provided by the nettle(2)
library.

2.1 Downloading and installing
==============================

GnuTLS is available for download at:
`http://www.gnutls.org/download.html'

GnuTLS uses a development cycle where even minor version numbers
indicate a stable release and a odd minor version number indicate a
development release.  For example, GnuTLS 1.6.3 denote a stable release
since 6 is even, and GnuTLS 1.7.11 denote a development release since 7
is odd.

GnuTLS depends on Libnettle, and you will need to install it before
installing GnuTLS.  Libnettle is available from
`http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/'.  Don't forget to verify the
cryptographic signature after downloading source code packages.

The package is then extracted, configured and built like many other
packages that use Autoconf.  For detailed information on configuring
and building it, refer to the `INSTALL' file that is part of the
distribution archive.  Typically you invoke `./configure' and then
`make check install'.  There are a number of compile-time parameters,
as discussed below.

The compression library, libz, as well as p11-kit are a optional
dependencies.  You can get libz from `http://www.zlib.net/' and p11-kit
from `http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/'.

The X.509 part of GnuTLS needs ASN.1 functionality, from a library
called libtasn1.  A copy of libtasn1 is included in GnuTLS.  If you
want to install it separately (e.g., to make it possibly to use
libtasn1 in other programs), you can get it from
`http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/download.html'.

A few `configure' options may be relevant, summarized below.  They
disable or enable particular features, to create a smaller library with
only the required features.

--disable-srp-authentication
--disable-psk-authentication
--disable-anon-authentication
--disable-extra-pki
--disable-openpgp-authentication
--disable-openssl-compatibility
--without-p11-kit

For the complete list, refer to the output from `configure --help'.

2.2 General idea
================

A brief description of how GnuTLS works internally is shown at *note
fig:gnutls-design::. This section may be easier to understand after
having seen the examples at *note examples::.  As shown in the figure,
there is a read-only global state that is initialized once by the
global initialization function.  This global structure, among others,
contains the memory allocation functions used, and structures needed
for the ASN.1 parser.  This structure is never modified by any GnuTLS
function, except for the deinitialization function which frees all
allocated memory and is called after the program has permanently
finished using GnuTLS.

 [image src="gnutls-internals.png" ]

Figure 2.1: High level design of GnuTLS.

The credentials structures are used by the authentication methods, such
as certificate authentication. They store certificates, privates keys,
and other information that is needed to prove the identity to the peer,
and/or verify the indentity of the peer. The information stored in the
credentials structures is initialized once and then can be shared by
many TLS sessions.

A GnuTLS session contains all the required information to handle one
secure connection. The session communicates with the peers using the
provided functions of the transport layer.  Every session has a unique
session ID shared with the peer.

Since TLS sessions can be resumed, servers need a database back-end to
hold the session's parameters.  Every GnuTLS session after a successful
handshake calls the appropriate back-end function (see *note resume::)
to store the newly negotiated session. The session database is examined
by the server just after having received the client hello(1), and if
the session ID sent by the client, matches a stored session, the stored
session will be retrieved, and the new session will be a resumed one,
and will share the same session ID with the previous one.

2.3 Error handling
==================

2.3.1 Conventions
-----------------

In GnuTLS most functions return an integer type as a result.  In almost
all cases a zero or a positive number means success, and a negative
number indicates failure, or a situation that some action has to be
taken. Thus negative error codes may be fatal or not.

Fatal errors terminate the connection immediately and further sends and
receives will be disallowed.  Such an example is
`GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED'. Non-fatal errors may warn about
something, i.e., a warning alert was received, or indicate the some
action has to be taken. This is the case with the error code
`GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' returned by *note gnutls_record_recv::.  This
error code indicates that the server requests a re-handshake. The
client may ignore this request, or may reply with an alert.  You can
test if an error code is a fatal one by using the *note
gnutls_error_is_fatal::.

If any non fatal errors, that require an action, are to be returned by
a function, these error codes will be documented in the function's
reference.  See *note Error codes::, for a description of the available
error codes.

2.3.2 Debugging and auditing
----------------------------

In many cases things may not go as expected and further information, to
assist debugging, from GnuTLS is desired.  Those are the cases where
the *note gnutls_global_set_log_level:: and *note
gnutls_global_set_log_function:: are to be used. Those will print
verbose information on the GnuTLS functions internal flow.

   * *note gnutls_global_set_log_level::

   * *note gnutls_global_set_log_function::

When debugging is not required, important issues, such as detected
attacks on the protocol still need to be logged. This is provided by
the logging function set by *note
gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function::. The provided function will
receive an message and the corresponding TLS session. The session
information might be used to derive IP addresses or other information
about the peer involved.

   * *note gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Thread safety,  Next: Callback functions,  Prev: Error handling,  Up: The Library

2.4 Thread safety
=================

The GnuTLS library is thread safe by design, meaning that objects of
the library such as TLS sessions, can be safely divided across threads
as long as a single thread accesses a single object. This is sufficient
to support a server which handles several sessions per thread.  If,
however, an object needs to be shared across threads then access must be
protected with a mutex. Read-only access to objects, for example the
credentials holding structures (see *note Authentication methods::), is
also thread-safe.

The random generator of the cryptographic back-end, is not thread safe
and requires mutex locks which are setup by GnuTLS.  Applications can
either call *note gnutls_global_init:: which will initialize the default
operating system provided locks (i.e. `pthreads' on GNU/Linux and
`CriticalSection' on Windows), or specify manually the locking system
using the function *note gnutls_global_set_mutex:: before calling *note
gnutls_global_init::.  Setting manually mutexes is recommended only to
applications that have full control of the underlying libraries. If this
is not the case, the use of the operating system defaults is
recommended. An example of non-native thread usage is shown below.

     #include <gnutls.h>

     /* Other thread packages
      */

     int main()
     {
        gnutls_global_set_mutex (mutex_init, mutex_deinit,
                                 mutex_lock, mutex_unlock);
        gnutls_global_init();
     }

   * *note gnutls_global_set_mutex::

2.5 Callback functions
======================

There are several cases where GnuTLS may need out of band input from
your program. This is now implemented using some callback functions,
which your program is expected to register.

An example of this type of functions are the push and pull callbacks
which are used to specify the functions that will retrieve and send
data to the transport layer.

   * *note gnutls_transport_set_push_function::

   * *note gnutls_transport_set_pull_function::

Other callback functions may require more complicated input and data to
be allocated. Such an example is *note
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function::.  All callbacks should
allocate and free memory using the functions shown below.

   * *note gnutls_malloc::

   * *note gnutls_free::

3 Introduction to TLS and DTLS
******************************

TLS stands for "Transport Layer Security" and is the successor of SSL,
the Secure Sockets Layer protocol [`SSL3']

designed by Netscape.  TLS is an Internet protocol, defined by IETF(1),
described in [`RFC5246'] .  The protocol provides confidentiality, and
authentication layers over any reliable transport layer.  The
description, below, refers to TLS 1.0 but also applies to TLS 1.2
[`RFC5246']  and SSL 3.0, since the differences of these protocols are
not major.

The DTLS protocol, or "Datagram TLS" [`RFC4347']  is a protocol with
identical goals as TLS, but can operate under unreliable transport
layers, such as UDP. The discussions below apply to this protocol as
well, except when noted otherwise.

3.1 TLS layers
==============

TLS is a layered protocol, and consists of the record protocol, the
handshake protocol and the alert protocol. The record protocol is to
serve all other protocols and is above the transport layer.  The record
protocol offers symmetric encryption, data authenticity, and optionally
compression.  The alert protocol offers some signaling to the other
protocols. It can help informing the peer for the cause of failures and
other error conditions.  *Note The Alert Protocol::, for more
information.  The alert protocol is above the record protocol.

The handshake protocol is responsible for the security parameters'
negotiation, the initial key exchange and authentication.  *Note The
Handshake Protocol::, for more information about the handshake
protocol.  The protocol layering in TLS is shown in *note
fig:tls-layers::.

3.2 The transport layer
=======================

TLS is not limited to any transport layer and can be used above any
transport layer, as long as it is a reliable one.  DTLS can be used
over reliable and unreliable transport layers.  GnuTLS supports TCP and
UDP layers transparently using the Berkeley sockets API. However, any
transport layer can be used by providing callbacks for GnuTLS to access
the transport layer (for details see *note TLS and DTLS sessions::).


File: gnutls.info,  Node: The TLS record protocol,  Next: The TLS Alert Protocol,  Prev: The transport layer,  Up: Introduction to TLS

3.3 The TLS record protocol
===========================

The record protocol is the secure communications provider. Its purpose
is to encrypt, authenticate and --optionally-- compress packets.  The
record layer functions can be called at any time after the handshake
process is finished, when there is need to receive or send data. In
DTLS however, due to re-transmission timers used in the handshake
out-of-order handshake data might be received for some time (maximum 60
seconds) after the handshake process is finished. For this reason
programs using DTLS should call *note gnutls_record_recv:: or *note
gnutls_record_recv_seq:: for every packet received by the peer, even if
no data were expected.

As you may have already noticed, the functions which access the record
protocol, are quite limited, given the importance of this protocol in
TLS.  This is because the record protocol's parameters are all set by
the handshake protocol.  The record protocol initially starts with NULL
parameters, which means no encryption, and no MAC is used. Encryption
and authentication begin just after the handshake protocol has finished.

3.3.1 Encryption algorithms used in the record layer
----------------------------------------------------

Confidentiality in the record layer is achieved by using symmetric
block encryption algorithms like `3DES', `AES' or stream algorithms
like `ARCFOUR_128'.   Ciphers are encryption algorithms that use a
single, secret, key to encrypt and decrypt data. Block algorithms in
TLS also provide protection against statistical analysis of the data.
Thus, if you're using the TLS protocol, a random number of blocks will
be appended to data, to prevent eavesdroppers from guessing the actual
data size.

The supported in GnuTLS ciphers and MAC algorithms are shown in *note
tab:ciphers:: and *note tab:macs::.

Algorithm      Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
3DES_CBC        This is the DES block cipher algorithm used with
               triple encryption (EDE). Has 64 bits block size
               and is used in CBC mode.
ARCFOUR_128     ARCFOUR_128 is a compatible algorithm with RSA's
               RC4 algorithm, which is considered to be a trade
               secret. It is a fast cipher but considered weak
               today.
ARCFOUR_40      This is the ARCFOUR cipher fed with a 40 bit key,
               which is considered weak.
AES_CBC         AES or RIJNDAEL is the block cipher algorithm
               that replaces the old DES algorithm.  Has 128
               bits block size and is used in CBC mode.
AES_GCM         This is the AES algorithm in the authenticated
               encryption GCM mode.  This mode combines message
               authentication and encryption and can be
               extremely fast on CPUs that support hardware
               acceleration.
CAMELLIA_CBC    This is an 128-bit block cipher developed by
               Mitsubishi and NTT. It is one of the approved
               ciphers of the European NESSIE and Japanese
               CRYPTREC projects.

Table 3.1: Supported ciphers.

Algorithm      Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
MAC_MD5         This is a cryptographic hash algorithm designed
               by Ron Rivest. Outputs 128 bits of data.
MAC_SHA1        A cryptographic hash algorithm designed by NSA.
               Outputs 160 bits of data.
MAC_SHA256      A cryptographic hash algorithm designed by NSA.
               Outputs 256 bits of data.
MAC_AEAD        This indicates that an authenticated encryption
               algorithm, such as GCM, is in use.

3.3.2 Compression algorithms used in the record layer
-----------------------------------------------------

The TLS record layer also supports compression.  The algorithms
implemented in GnuTLS can be found in the table below.  The included
algorithms perform really good when text, or other compressible data
are to be transferred, but offer nothing on already compressed data,
such as compressed images, zipped archives etc.  These compression
algorithms, may be useful in high bandwidth TLS tunnels, and in cases
where network usage has to be minimized. It should be noted however
that compression increases latency.

The record layer compression in GnuTLS is implemented based on the
proposal [`RFC3749'] . The supported algorithms are shown in *note
gnutls_compression_method_t::.

   * GNUTLS_COMP_UNKNOWN Unknown compression method.

   * GNUTLS_COMP_NULL The NULL compression method (no compression).

   * GNUTLS_COMP_DEFLATE The DEFLATE compression method from zlib.

   * GNUTLS_COMP_ZLIB Same as .

3.3.3 Weaknesses and countermeasures
------------------------------------

Some weaknesses that may affect the security of the record layer have
been found in TLS 1.0 protocol. These weaknesses can be exploited by
active attackers, and exploit the facts that

  1. TLS has separate alerts for "decryption_failed" and
     "bad_record_mac"

  2. The decryption failure reason can be detected by timing the
     response time.

  3. The IV for CBC encrypted packets is the last block of the previous
     encrypted packet.


Those weaknesses were solved in TLS 1.1 [`RFC4346']

which is implemented in GnuTLS. For a detailed discussion see the
archives of the TLS Working Group mailing list and [`CBCATT'] .


File: gnutls.info,  Node: On Record Padding,  Prev: Weaknesses and countermeasures,  Up: The TLS record protocol

3.3.4 On record padding
-----------------------

The TLS protocol allows for random padding of records, to prevent
statistical analysis based on the length of exchanged messages (see
[`RFC5246']  section 6.2.3.2).  GnuTLS appears to be one of few
implementation that take advantage of this text, and pad records by a
random length.

The TLS implementation in the Symbian operating system, frequently used
by Nokia and Sony-Ericsson mobile phones, cannot handle non-minimal
record padding.  What happens when one of these clients handshake with
a GnuTLS server is that the client will fail to compute the correct MAC
for the record.  The client sends a TLS alert (`bad_record_mac') and
disconnects.  Typically this will result in error messages such as 'A
TLS fatal alert has been received', 'Bad record MAC', or both, on the
GnuTLS server side.

GnuTLS implements a work around for this problem.  However, it has to
be enabled specifically.  It can be enabled by using *note
gnutls_record_disable_padding::, or *note gnutls_priority_set:: with
the `%COMPAT' priority string (see *note Priority Strings::).

If you implement an application that have a configuration file, we
recommend that you make it possible for users or administrators to
specify a GnuTLS protocol priority string, which is used by your
application via *note gnutls_priority_set::.  To allow the best
flexibility, make it possible to have a different priority string for
different incoming IP addresses.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: The TLS Alert Protocol,  Next: The TLS Handshake Protocol,  Prev: The TLS record protocol,  Up: Introduction to TLS

3.4 The TLS alert protocol
==========================

The alert protocol is there to allow signals to be sent between peers.
These signals are mostly used to inform the peer about the cause of a
protocol failure. Some of these signals are used internally by the
protocol and the application protocol does not have to cope with them
(e.g. `GNUTLS_A_CLOSE_NOTIFY'), and others refer to the application
protocol solely (e.g. `GNUTLS_A_USER_CANCELLED').  An alert signal
includes a level indication which may be either fatal or warning. Fatal
alerts always terminate the current connection, and prevent future
re-negotiations using the current session ID. All alert messages are
summarized in *note tab:alerts::.

The alert messages are protected by the record protocol, thus the
information that is included does not leak. You must take extreme care
for the alert information not to leak to a possible attacker, via
public log files etc. The available functions to control the alert
protocol are shown below.

3.5 The TLS handshake protocol
==============================

The handshake protocol is responsible for the ciphersuite negotiation,
the initial key exchange, and the authentication of the two peers.
This is fully controlled by the application layer, thus your program
has to set up the required parameters. The main handshake function is
*note gnutls_handshake::. In the next paragraphs we elaborate on the
handshake protocol, i.e., the ciphersuite negotiation.

* Menu:

* TLS Cipher Suites::           TLS session parameters.
* Client Authentication::       Requesting a certificate from the client.
* Resuming Sessions::           Reusing previously established keys.
* Interoperability::            About interoperability with other implementations.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Cipher Suites,  Next: Client Authentication,  Up: The TLS Handshake Protocol

3.5.1 TLS ciphersuites
----------------------

The handshake protocol of TLS negotiates cipher suites of a special
form illustrated by the `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_CBC_SHA' cipher suite
name.  A typical cipher suite contains these parameters:

   * The key exchange algorithm.  `DHE_RSA' in the example.

   * The Symmetric encryption algorithm and mode `3DES_CBC' in this
     example.

   * The MAC(1) algorithm used for authentication.  `MAC_SHA' is used
     in the above example.


The cipher suite negotiated in the handshake protocol will affect the
record protocol, by enabling encryption and data authentication.  Note
that you should not over rely on TLS to negotiate the strongest
available cipher suite. Do not enable ciphers and algorithms that you
consider weak.

All the supported ciphersuites are listed in *note ciphersuites::.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) MAC stands for Message Authentication Code. It can be described as
a keyed hash algorithm. See RFC2104.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Client Authentication,  Next: Resuming Sessions,  Prev: TLS Cipher Suites,  Up: The TLS Handshake Protocol

3.5.2 Client authentication
---------------------------

In the case of ciphersuites that use certificate authentication, the
authentication of the client is optional in TLS.  A server may request
a certificate from the client using the *note
gnutls_certificate_server_set_request:: function. If a certificate is
to be requested from the client during the handshake, the server will
send a certificate request message that contains a list of acceptable
certificate signers. In GnuTLS the certificate signers list is
constructed using the trusted Certificate Authorities by the server.
That is the ones set using the following functions.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_mem::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_server_set_request::

In cases where the server supports a large number of certificate
authorities it makes sense not to advertise all of the names to save
bandwidth. That can be controlled using the function *note
gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence::.  This however will have
the side-effect of not restricting the client to certificates signed by
server's acceptable signers.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Resuming Sessions,  Next: Interoperability,  Prev: Client Authentication,  Up: The TLS Handshake Protocol

3.5.3 Resuming sessions
-----------------------

The *note gnutls_handshake:: function, is expensive since a lot of
calculations are performed. In order to support many fast connections
to the same server a client may use session resuming. Session resuming
is a feature of the TLS protocol which allows a client to connect to a
server, after a successful handshake, without the expensive
calculations.  This is achieved by re-using the previously established
keys. GnuTLS supports this feature, and the example in *note
ex:resume-client:: illustrates a typical use of it.

Keep in mind that sessions might be expired after some time, thus it
may be normal for a server not to resume a session even if you
requested that.  That is to prevent temporal session keys from becoming
long-term keys. Also note that as a client you must enable, using the
priority functions, at least the algorithms used in the last session.

The resuming capability, mostly in the server side, is one of the
problems of a thread-safe TLS implementations. The problem is that all
threads must share information in order to be able to resume sessions.
The gnutls approach is, in case of a client, to leave all the burden of
resuming to the client. That is, copy and keep the necessary
parameters. The relevant functions are listed below.

   * *note gnutls_session_get_data::

   * *note gnutls_session_get_id::

   * *note gnutls_session_set_data::

Server side is different. A server needs to specify callback functions
which store, retrieve and delete session data. These can be registered
with the functions shown below.

   * *note gnutls_db_set_retrieve_function::

   * *note gnutls_db_set_store_function::

   * *note gnutls_db_set_ptr::

   * *note gnutls_db_set_remove_function::

It might also be useful to be able to check for expired sessions in
order to remove them, and save space. The function *note
gnutls_db_check_entry:: is provided for that reason.

   * *note gnutls_db_check_entry::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Interoperability,  Prev: Resuming Sessions,  Up: The TLS Handshake Protocol

3.5.4 Interoperability
----------------------

The TLS handshake is a complex procedure that negotiates all required
parameters for a secure session. GnuTLS supports several TLS
extensions, as well as the latest TLS protocol version 1.2. However few
implementations are not able to properly interoperate once faced with
extensions or version protocols they do not support and understand. The
TLS protocol allows for a graceful downgrade to the commonly supported
options, but practice shows it is not always implemented correctly.

Because there is no way to achieve maximum interoperability with broken
peers without sacrificing security, GnuTLS ignores such peers by
default.  This might not be acceptable in cases where maximum
compatibility is required. Thus we allow enabling compatibility with
broken peers using priority strings (see *note Priority Strings::). An
example priority string that is known to provide wide compatibility
even with broken peers is shown below:
NORMAL:-VERS-TLS-ALL:+VERS-TLS1.0:+VERS-SSL3.0:%COMPAT
 This priority string will only enable SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 as protocols
and will disable, via the `%COMPAT' keyword, several TLS protocol
options that are known to cause compatibility problems. Note however
that there are known attacks against those protocol versions and if
mode is used security is traded for compatibility.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Extensions,  Next: Selecting cryptographic key sizes,  Prev: The TLS Handshake Protocol,  Up: Introduction to TLS

3.6 TLS extensions
==================

A number of extensions to the TLS protocol have been proposed mainly in
[`TLSEXT'] . The extensions supported in GnuTLS are:

   * Maximum fragment length negotiation

   * Server name indication

   * Session tickets

   * Safe Renegotiation

and they will be discussed in the subsections that follow.

3.6.1 Maximum fragment length negotiation
-----------------------------------------

This extension allows a TLS implementation to negotiate a smaller value
for record packet maximum length. This extension may be useful to
clients with constrained capabilities. The functions shown below can be
used to control this extension.

   * *note gnutls_record_get_max_size::

   * *note gnutls_record_set_max_size::

3.6.2 Server name indication
----------------------------

A common problem in HTTPS servers is the fact that the TLS protocol is
not aware of the hostname that a client connects to, when the handshake
procedure begins. For that reason the TLS server has no way to know
which certificate to send.

This extension solves that problem within the TLS protocol, and allows
a client to send the HTTP hostname before the handshake begins within
the first handshake packet.  The functions *note
gnutls_server_name_set:: and *note gnutls_server_name_get:: can be used
to enable this extension, or to retrieve the name sent by a client.

   * *note gnutls_server_name_set::

   * *note gnutls_server_name_get::

3.6.3 Session tickets
---------------------

To resume a TLS session the server normally store some state.  This
complicates deployment, and typical situations the client can cache
information and send it to the server instead.  The Session Ticket
extension implements this idea, and it is documented in RFC 5077
[`TLSTKT'] .

Clients can enable support for TLS tickets with *note
gnutls_session_ticket_enable_client:: and servers use *note
gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate:: to generate a key and *note
gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server:: to enable the extension.  Clients
resume sessions using the normal session resumption procedure (see
*note resume::).

   * *note gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate::

   * *note gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server::

   * *note gnutls_session_ticket_enable_client::

3.6.4 Safe renegotiation
------------------------

TLS gives the option to two communicating parties to renegotiate and
update their security parameters. One useful example of this feature
was for a client to initially connect using anonymous negotiation to a
server, and the renegotiate using some authenticated ciphersuite. This
occurred to avoid having the client sending its credentials in the
clear.

However this renegotiation, as initially designed would not ensure that
the party one is renegotiating is the same as the one in the initial
negotiation.  For example one server could forward all renegotiation
traffic to an other server who will see this traffic as an initial
negotiation attempt.

This might be seen as a valid design decision, but it seems it was not
widely known or understood, thus today some application protocols the
TLS renegotiation feature in a manner that enables a malicious server
to insert content of his choice in the beginning of a TLS session.

The most prominent vulnerability was with HTTPS. There servers request
a renegotiation to enforce an anonymous user to use a certificate in
order to access certain parts of a web site.  The attack works by
having the attacker simulate a client and connect to a server, with
server-only authentication, and send some data intended to cause harm.
The server will then require renegotiation from him in order to perform
the request.  When the proper client attempts to contact the server,
the attacker hijacks that connection and forwards traffic to the
initial server that requested renegotiation.  The attacker will not be
able to read the data exchanged between the client and the server.
However, the server will (incorrectly) assume that the initial request
sent by the attacker was sent by the now authenticated client.  The
result is a prefix plain-text injection attack.

The above is just one example.  Other vulnerabilities exists that do
not rely on the TLS renegotiation to change the client's authenticated
status (either TLS or application layer).

While fixing these application protocols and implementations would be
one natural reaction, an extension to TLS has been designed that
cryptographically binds together any renegotiated handshakes with the
initial negotiation.  When the extension is used, the attack is
detected and the session can be terminated.  The extension is specified
in [`RFC5746'] .

GnuTLS supports the safe renegotiation extension.  The default behavior
is as follows.  Clients will attempt to negotiate the safe
renegotiation extension when talking to servers.  Servers will accept
the extension when presented by clients.  Clients and servers will
permit an initial handshake to complete even when the other side does
not support the safe renegotiation extension.  Clients and servers will
refuse renegotiation attempts when the extension has not been
negotiated.

Note that permitting clients to connect to servers when the safe
renegotiation extension is not enabled, is open up for attacks.
Changing this default behavior would prevent interoperability against
the majority of deployed servers out there.  We will reconsider this
default behavior in the future when more servers have been upgraded.
Note that it is easy to configure clients to always require the safe
renegotiation extension from servers.

To modify the default behavior, we have introduced some new priority
strings (see *note Priority Strings::).  The `%UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION'
priority string permits (re-)handshakes even when the safe
renegotiation extension was not negotiated. The default behavior is
`%PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION' that will prevent renegotiation with clients
and servers not supporting the extension. This is secure for servers
but leaves clients vulnerable to some attacks, but this is a trade-off
between security and compatibility with old servers. The
`%SAFE_RENEGOTIATION' priority string makes clients and servers require
the extension for every handshake. The latter is the most secure option
for clients, at the cost of not being able to connect to legacy
servers. Servers will also deny clients that do not support the
extension from connecting.

It is possible to disable use of the extension completely, in both
clients and servers, by using the `%DISABLE_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION'
priority string however we strongly recommend you to only do this for
debugging and test purposes.

The default values if the flags above are not specified are:
`Server:'
     %PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION

`Client:'
     %PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION


For applications we have introduced a new API related to safe
renegotiation.  The *note gnutls_safe_renegotiation_status:: function is
used to check if the extension has been negotiated on a session, and
can be used both by clients and servers.

3.7 Selecting cryptographic key sizes
=====================================

Because many algorithms are involved in TLS, it is not easy to set a
consistent security level.  For this reason in *note tab:key-sizes:: we
present some correspondence between key sizes of symmetric algorithms
and public key algorithms based on [`ECRYPT'] .  Those can be used to
generate certificates with appropriate key sizes as well as select
parameters for Diffie-Hellman and SRP authentication.

bits    and SRP   key     parameter

Table 3.4: Key sizes and security parameters.

The first column  provides a security parameter in a number of bits.
This gives an indication of the number of combinations to be tried by
an adversary to brute force a key. For example to test all possible
keys in a 112 bit security parameter 2^112 combinations have to be
tried. For today's technology this is infeasible.  The next two columns
correlate the security parameter with actual bit sizes of parameters
for DH, RSA, SRP and ECC algorithms.  A mapping to `gnutls_sec_param_t'
value is given for each security parameter, on the next column, and
finally a brief description of the level.

Note, however, that the values suggested here are nothing more than an
educated guess that is valid today. There are no guarantees that an
algorithm will remain unbreakable or that these values will remain
constant in time. There could be scientific breakthroughs that cannot
be predicted or total failure of the current public key systems by
quantum computers. On the other hand though the cryptosystems used in
TLS are selected in a conservative way and such catastrophic
breakthroughs or failures are believed to be unlikely.  The NIST
publication SP 800-57 [`NISTSP80057']  contains a similar table.

When using GnuTLS and a decision on bit sizes for a public key
algorithm is required, use of the following functions is recommended:

   * *note gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits::

   * *note gnutls_pk_bits_to_sec_param::

Those functions will convert a human understandable security parameter
of `gnutls_sec_param_t' type, to a number of bits suitable for a public
key algorithm.

3.8 How to use TLS in application protocols
===========================================

This chapter is intended to provide some hints on how to use the TLS
over simple custom made application protocols.  The discussion below
mainly refers to the TCP/IP transport layer but may be extended to
other ones too.

* Menu:

* Separate ports::
* Upward negotiation::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Separate ports,  Next: Upward negotiation,  Up: How to use TLS in application protocols

3.8.1 Separate ports
--------------------

Traditionally SSL was used in application protocols by assigning a new
port number for the secure services. That way two separate ports were
assigned, one for the non secure sessions, and one for the secured
ones. This has the benefit that if a user requests a secure session
then the client will try to connect to the secure port and fail
otherwise. The only possible attack with this method is a denial of
service one. The most famous example of this method is the famous "HTTP
over TLS" or HTTPS protocol [`RFC2818'] .

Despite its wide use, this method is not as good as it seems.  This
approach starts the TLS Handshake procedure just after the client
connects on the --so called-- secure port.  That way the TLS protocol
does not know anything about the client, and popular methods like the
host advertising in HTTP do not work(1).  There is no way for the
client to say "I connected to YYY server" before the Handshake starts,
so the server cannot possibly know which certificate to use.

Other than that it requires two separate ports to run a single service,
which is unnecessary complication. Due to the fact that there is a
limitation on the available privileged ports, this approach was soon
obsoleted.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Upward negotiation,  Prev: Separate ports,  Up: How to use TLS in application protocols

3.8.2 Upward negotiation
------------------------

Other application protocols(1)  use a different approach to enable the
secure layer.  They use something often called as the "TLS upgrade"
method. This method is quite tricky but it is more flexible. The idea
is to extend the application protocol to have a "STARTTLS" request,
whose purpose it to start the TLS protocols just after the client
requests it.  This approach does not require any extra port to be
reserved.  There is even an extension to HTTP protocol to support that
method [`RFC2817'] .

The tricky part, in this method, is that the "STARTTLS" request is sent
in the clear, thus is vulnerable to modifications.  A typical attack is
to modify the messages in a way that the client is fooled and thinks
that the server does not have the "STARTTLS" capability.  See a typical
conversation of a hypothetical protocol:

     (client connects to the server)

     CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

     SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

     CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

     SERVER: OK

     *** TLS STARTS

     CLIENT: HERE ARE SOME CONFIDENTIAL DATA

And see an example of a conversation where someone is acting in between:

     (client connects to the server)

     CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

     SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

     CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

     (here someone inserts this message)

     SERVER: SORRY I DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY

     CLIENT: HERE ARE SOME CONFIDENTIAL DATA

As you can see above the client was fooled, and was dummy enough to
send the confidential data in the clear.

How to avoid the above attack? As you may have already noticed this one
is easy to avoid. The client has to ask the user before it connects
whether the user requests TLS or not. If the user answered that he
certainly wants the secure layer the last conversation should be:

     (client connects to the server)

     CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

     SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

     CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

     (here someone inserts this message)

     SERVER: SORRY I DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY

     CLIENT: BYE

     (the client notifies the user that the secure connection was not
     possible)

This method, if implemented properly, is far better than the
traditional method, and the security properties remain the same, since
only denial of service is possible. The benefit is that the server may
request additional data before the TLS Handshake protocol starts, in
order to send the correct certificate, use the correct password file,
or anything else!

3.9 On SSL 2 and older protocols
================================

One of the initial decisions in the GnuTLS development was to implement
the known security protocols for the transport layer.  Initially TLS
1.0 was implemented since it was the latest at that time, and was
considered to be the most advanced in security properties.  Later the
SSL 3.0 protocol was implemented since it is still the only protocol
supported by several servers and there are no serious security
vulnerabilities known.

One question that may arise is why we didn't implement SSL 2.0 in the
library.  There are several reasons, most important being that it has
serious security flaws, unacceptable for a modern security library.
Other than that, this protocol is barely used by anyone these days
since it has been deprecated since 1996.  The security problems in SSL
2.0 include:

   * Message integrity compromised.  The SSLv2 message authentication
     uses the MD5 function, and is insecure.

   * Man-in-the-middle attack.  There is no protection of the handshake
     in SSLv2, which permits a man-in-the-middle attack.

   * Truncation attack.  SSLv2 relies on TCP FIN to close the session,
     so the attacker can forge a TCP FIN, and the peer cannot tell if
     it was a legitimate end of data or not.

   * Weak message integrity for export ciphers.  The cryptographic keys
     in SSLv2 are used for both message authentication and encryption,
     so if weak encryption schemes are negotiated (say 40-bit keys) the
     message authentication code use the same weak key, which isn't
     necessary.


Other protocols such as Microsoft's PCT 1 and PCT 2 were not
implemented because they were also abandoned and deprecated by SSL 3.0
and later TLS 1.0.

4 Authentication methods
************************

The TLS protocol provides confidentiality and encryption, but also
offers authentication, which is a prerequisite for a secure connection.
The available authentication methods in GnuTLS are:

   * Certificate authentication: Authenticated key exchange using
     public key infrastructure and certificates (X.509 or OpenPGP).

   * SRP authentication: Authenticated key exchange using a password.

   * PSK authentication: Authenticated key exchange using a pre-shared
     key.

   * Anonymous authentication: Key exchange without peer authentication.


The rule for each method is to allocate a credentials structure
containing data required for authentication and associate that
structure with the session using *note gnutls_credentials_set::.
Various authentication methods might require additional data to be
stored in the credential structures, such as ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
parameters etc.  In the next paragraphs we elaborate on supported
authentication methods.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Certificate authentication,  Next: Anonymous authentication,  Up: Authentication methods

4.1 Certificate authentication
==============================

4.1.1 Authentication using X.509 certificates
---------------------------------------------

X.509 certificates contain the public parameters, of a public key
algorithm, and an authority's signature, which proves the authenticity
of the parameters.  See *note X.509 certificates::, for more
information on X.509 protocols.

4.1.2 Authentication using OpenPGP keys
---------------------------------------

OpenPGP keys also contain public parameters of a public key algorithm,
and signatures from several other parties. Depending on whether a
signer is trusted the key is considered trusted or not.  GnuTLS's
OpenPGP authentication implementation is based on the [`TLSPGP']
proposal.

More information on the OpenPGP trusted model is provided in *note
OpenPGP certificates::.  For a more detailed introduction to OpenPGP
and GnuPG see [`GPGH'] .

In GnuTLS both the OpenPGP and X.509 certificates are part of the
certificate authentication and thus are handled using a common API.
When using certificates the server is required to have at least one
certificate and private key pair. A client may or may not have such a
pair.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_free_credentials::

After the credentials structures are initialized using the functions
above, the certificate and key pair should be loaded. This should occur
before any TLS session is initialized.  Depending on the certificate
type different loading functions are available, and are shown below.
In the X.509 case, the functions will also accept and use a certificate
list that leads to a trusted authority. The certificate list must be
ordered in such way that every certificate certifies the one before it.
The trusted authority's certificate need not to be included, since the
peer should possess it already.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_file::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_mem::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_key::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file::

As an alternative to loading from files, a callback may be used so that
the server or the client can specify the certificate and the key at the
handshake time.  In that case a certificate should be selected
according the peer's signature algorithm preferences. To get those
preferences use *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested::. Both
functions are shown below.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function::

   * *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested::

Certificate verification is possible by loading the trusted authorities
into the credentials structure by using the following functions,
applicable to X.509 and OpenPGP certificates.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_file::

Note however that the peer's certificate is not automatically verified,
you should call *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2::, after a
successful handshake or during if *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function:: has been used, to verify the
certificate's signature.  An alternative way, which reports a more
detailed verification output, is to use *note
gnutls_certificate_get_peers:: to obtain the raw certificate of the
peer and verify it using the functions discussed in *note X.509
certificates::.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2::

In a handshake, the negotiated cipher suite also depends on the
certificate's parameters, so some key exchange methods might not be
available with some certificates. GnuTLS will disable ciphersuites that
are not compatible with the key, or the enabled authentication methods.
For example keys marked as sign-only, will not be able to access the
plain RSA ciphersuites, that require decryption. It is not recommended
to use RSA keys for both signing and encryption. If possible use a
different key for the `DHE_RSA' which uses signing and `RSA' that
requires decryption.  All the key exchange methods shown in *note
tab:key-exchange:: are available in certificate authentication.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function::

Note that the DHE key exchange methods are generally slower(1) than the
elliptic curves counterpart (ECDHE). Moreover the plain Diffie-Hellman
key exchange requires parameters to be generated and associated with a
credentials structure by the server (see *note Parameter generation::).

Key exchange   Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
RSA             The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt a key and
               send it to the peer.  The certificate must allow
               the key to be used for encryption.
RSA_EXPORT      The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt a key and
               send it to the peer.  In the EXPORT algorithm,
               the server signs temporary RSA parameters of 512
               bits -- which are considered weak -- and sends
               them to the client.
DHE_RSA         The RSA algorithm is used to sign ephemeral
               Diffie-Hellman parameters which are sent to the
               peer. The key in the certificate must allow the
               key to be used for signing. Note that key
               exchange algorithms which use ephemeral
               Diffie-Hellman parameters, offer perfect forward
               secrecy. That means that even if the private key
               used for signing is compromised, it cannot be
               used to reveal past session data.
ECDHE_RSA       The RSA algorithm is used to sign ephemeral
               elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman parameters which
               are sent to the peer. The key in the certificate
               must allow the key to be used for signing. It
               also offers perfect forward secrecy. That means
               that even if the private key used for signing is
               compromised, it cannot be used to reveal past
               session data.
DHE_DSS         The DSA algorithm is used to sign ephemeral
               Diffie-Hellman parameters which are sent to the
               peer. The certificate must contain DSA parameters
               to use this key exchange algorithm. DSA is the
               algorithm of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS).
ECDHE_ECDSA     The Elliptic curve DSA algorithm is used to sign
               ephemeral elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
               parameters which are sent to the peer. The
               certificate must contain ECDSA parameters to use
               this key exchange algorithm.

faster, but also easier to break.  See *note Selecting cryptographic

4.2 Anonymous authentication
============================

The anonymous key exchange offers encryption without any indication of
the peer's identity.  This kind of authentication is vulnerable to a
man in the middle attack, but can be used even if there is no prior
communication or shared trusted parties with the peer. Moreover it is
useful when complete anonymity is required.  Unless in one of the above
cases, do not use anonymous authentication.

Note that the key exchange methods for anonymous authentication require
Diffie-Hellman parameters to be generated by the server and associated
with an anonymous credentials structure. Check *note Parameter
generation:: for more information.

The initialization functions for the credentials are shown below.

   * *note gnutls_anon_allocate_server_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_anon_allocate_client_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_anon_free_server_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_anon_free_client_credentials::

The available key exchange algorithms for anonymous authentication are
shown below.

`ANON_DH:'
     This algorithm exchanges Diffie-Hellman parameters.

`ANON_ECDH:'
     This algorithm exchanges elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman parameters.
     It is more efficient than ANON_DH on equivalent security levels.

4.3 Authentication using SRP
============================

GnuTLS supported authentication via the Secure Remote Password or SRP
protocol (see [`RFC2945,TOMSRP']  for a description).  The SRP key
exchange is an extension to the TLS protocol, and it provided an
authenticated with a password key exchange. The peers can be identified
using a single password, or there can be combinations where the client
is authenticated using SRP and the server using a certificate.

The advantage of SRP authentication, over other proposed secure
password authentication schemes, is that SRP is not susceptible to
off-line dictionary attacks.  Moreover, SRP does not require the server
to hold the user's password.  This kind of protection is similar to the
one used traditionally in the UNIX `/etc/passwd' file, where the
contents of this file did not cause harm to the system security if they
were revealed.  The SRP needs instead of the plain password something
called a verifier, which is calculated using the user's password, and
if stolen cannot be used to impersonate the user.  The Stanford SRP
libraries, include a PAM module that synchronizes the system's users
passwords with the SRP password files. That way SRP authentication
could be used for all users of a system.

The implementation in GnuTLS is based on [`TLSSRP'] . The supported key
exchange methods are shown below.

`SRP:'
     Authentication using the SRP protocol.

`SRP_DSS:'
     Client authentication using the SRP protocol. Server is
     authenticated using a certificate with DSA parameters.

`SRP_RSA:'
     Client authentication using the SRP protocol. Server is
     authenticated using a certificate with RSA parameters.


The initialization functions in SRP credentials differ between client
and server.

   * *note gnutls_srp_allocate_server_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_srp_allocate_client_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_srp_free_server_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_srp_free_client_credentials::

Clients supporting SRP should set the username and password prior to
connection, to the credentials structure.  Alternatively *note
gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function:: may be used instead, to
specify a callback function that should return the SRP username and
password.  The callback is called once during the TLS handshake.

   * *note gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function::

In server side the default behavior of GnuTLS is to read the usernames
and SRP verifiers from password files. These password file format is
compatible the with the _Stanford srp libraries_ format.  If a
different password file format is to be used, then *note
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function:: should be called, to set
an appropriate callback.

   * *note gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_file::

   * *note gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function::

Other helper functions are included in GnuTLS, used to generate and
maintain SRP verifiers and password files.  A program to manipulate the
required parameters for SRP authentication is also included.  See *note
srptool::, for more information.

   * *note gnutls_srp_verifier::

   * *note gnutls_srp_base64_encode::

   * *note gnutls_srp_base64_decode::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Authentication using PSK,  Next: Authentication and credentials,  Prev: Authentication using SRP,  Up: Authentication methods

4.4 Authentication using PSK
============================

Authentication using Pre-shared keys is a method to authenticate using
usernames and binary keys. This protocol avoids making use of public
key infrastructure and expensive calculations, thus it is suitable for
constraint clients.

The implementation in GnuTLS is based on [`TLSPSK'] .  The supported
PSK key exchange methods are:

`PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol.

`DHE-PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol and Diffie-Hellman key
     exchange.  This method offers perfect forward secrecy.

`ECDHE-PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol and Elliptic curve
     Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  This method offers perfect forward
     secrecy.


The initialization functions in PSK credentials differ between client
and server.

   * *note gnutls_psk_allocate_server_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_psk_allocate_client_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_psk_free_server_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_psk_free_client_credentials::

Clients supporting PSK should supply the username and key before a TLS
session is established.  Alternatively *note
gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function:: can be used to specify a
callback function. This has the advantage that the callback will be
called only if PSK has been negotiated.

   * *note gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials::

   * *note gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function::

In server side the default behavior of GnuTLS is to read the usernames
and PSK keys from a password file. The password file should contain
usernames and keys in hexadecimal format. The name of the password file
can be stored to the credentials structure by calling *note
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file::.  If a different password file
format is to be used, then a callback should be set instead by *note
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function::.

The server can help the client chose a suitable username and password,
by sending a hint. Note that there is no common profile for the PSK
hint and applications are discouraged to use it.  A server, may specify
the hint by calling *note gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint::.
The client can retrieve the hint, for example in the callback function,
using *note gnutls_psk_client_get_hint::.

   * *note gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file::

   * *note gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function::

   * *note gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint::

   * *note gnutls_psk_client_get_hint::

Helper functions to generate and maintain PSK keys are also included in
GnuTLS.

   * *note gnutls_key_generate::

   * *note gnutls_hex_encode::

   * *note gnutls_hex_decode::

4.5 Authentication and credentials
==================================

In GnuTLS every key exchange method is associated with a credentials
type. For a key exchange method to be available it must be listed as a
priority string (see *note Priority Strings::) and the corresponding
credentials type should be initialized and set using *note
gnutls_credentials_set::.  A mapping of the key exchange methods with
the credential types is shown in *note tab:key-exchange-cred::.

5.1 X.509 certificates
======================

The X.509 protocols rely on a hierarchical trust model. In this trust
model Certification Authorities (CAs) are used to certify entities.
Usually more than one certification authorities exist, and
certification authorities may certify other authorities to issue
certificates as well, following a hierarchical model.

 [image src="gnutls-x509.png" ]

Figure 5.1: An example of the X.509 hierarchical trust model.

One needs to trust one or more CAs for his secure communications. In
that case only the certificates issued by the trusted authorities are
acceptable.  The framework is illustrated on *note Figure 5.1: fig:x509.

5.1.1 X.509 certificate structure
---------------------------------

An X.509 certificate usually contains information about the certificate
holder, the signer, a unique serial number, expiration dates and some
other fields [`PKIX']  as shown in *note tab:x509::.

Field          Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
version         The field that indicates the version of the
               certificate.
serialNumber    This field holds a unique serial number per
               certificate.
signature       The issuing authority's signature.
issuer          Holds the issuer's distinguished name.
validity        The activation and expiration dates.
subject         The subject's distinguished name of the
               certificate.
extensions      The extensions are fields only present in
               version 3 certificates.

Table 5.1: X.509 certificate fields.

The certificate's _subject or issuer name_ is not just a single string.
It is a Distinguished name and in the ASN.1 notation is a sequence of
several object identifiers with their corresponding values. Some of
available OIDs to be used in an X.509 distinguished name are defined in
`gnutls/x509.h'.

The _Version_ field in a certificate has values either 1 or 3 for
version 3 certificates.  Version 1 certificates do not support the
extensions field so it is not possible to distinguish a CA from a
person, thus their usage should be avoided.

The _validity_ dates are there to indicate the date that the specific
certificate was activated and the date the certificate's key would be
considered invalid.

Certificate _extensions_ are there to include information about the
certificate's subject that did not fit in the typical certificate
fields. Those may be e-mail addresses, flags that indicate whether the
belongs to a CA etc.  All the supported X.509 version 3 extensions are
shown in *note tab:x509-ext::.

Extension              OID            Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Subject key id         2.5.29.14       An identifier of the key of
                                      the subject.
Authority key id       2.5.29.35       An identifier of the
                                      authority's key used to sign
                                      the certificate.
Subject alternative    2.5.29.17       Alternative names to

Basic constraints      2.5.29.19       Indicates whether this is a
                                      CA certificate or not, and
                                      specify the maximum path
                                      lengths of certificate
                                      chains.

                                      Proxy Certificates are
                                      specified in [`RFC3820'] .

Table 5.2: X.509 certificate extensions.

In GnuTLS the X.509 certificate structures are handled using the
`gnutls_x509_crt_t' type and the corresponding private keys with the
`gnutls_x509_privkey_t' type.  All the available functions for X.509
certificate handling have their prototypes in `gnutls/x509.h'. An
example program to demonstrate the X.509 parsing capabilities can be
found at *note ex:x509-info::.

5.1.2 Verifying X.509 certificate paths
---------------------------------------

Verifying certificate paths is important in X.509 authentication. For
this purpose the following functions are provided.

   * *note gnutls_x509_trust_list_init::

   * *note gnutls_x509_trust_list_deinit::

   * *note gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas::

   * *note gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt::

   * *note gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls::

   * *note gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt::

   * *note gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt::

The verification function will verify a given certificate chain against
a list of certificate authorities and certificate revocation lists, and
output a bit-wise OR of elements of the `gnutls_certificate_status_t'
enumeration shown in *note gnutls_certificate_status_t::.

   * GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID The certificate is not signed by one of the
     known authorities or the signature is invalid.

   * GNUTLS_CERT_REVOKED Certificate is revoked by its authority.  In
     X.509 this will be set only if CRLs are checked.

   * GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND The certificate's issuer is not known.
     This is the case if the issue is not included in the trusted
     certificate list.  not found.

   * GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_CA The certiﬁcate’s signer was not a
     CA. This may happen if this was a version 1 certiﬁcate, which is
     common with some CAs, or a version 3 certiﬁcate without the
     basic constrains extension.

   * GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM The certiﬁcate was signed using
     an in- secure algorithm such as MD2 or MD5. These algorithms have
     been broken and should not be trusted.

   * GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED The certificate is not yet activated.

   * GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED The certificate has expired.

Table 5.3

An example of certificate verification is shown in *note ex:verify2::.
It is also possible to have a set of certificates that are trusted for
a particular server but not to authorize other certificates.  This
purpose is served by the functions *note
gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt:: and *note
gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt::.

5.1.3 Verifying a certificate in the context of TLS session
-----------------------------------------------------------

When operating in the context of a TLS session, the trusted certificate
authority list has been set via the *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file:: and *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl_file::, thus it is not required to
setup a trusted list as above.  Convenience functions such as *note
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2:: are equivalent and will verify the
peer's certificate chain in a TLS session.

There is also the possibility to pass some input to the verification
functions in the form of flags. For *note
gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt:: the flags are passed
straightforward, but *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2:: depends
on the flags set by calling *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags::.  All the available flags are
part of the enumeration `gnutls_certificate_verify_flags' shown in
*note gnutls_certificate_verify_flags::.

   * GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_CA_SIGN If set a signer does not have to be
     a certificate authority. This flag should normaly be disabled,
     unless you know what this means.

Although the verification of a certificate path indicates that the
certificate is signed by trusted authority, does not reveal anything
about the peer's identity. It is required to verify if the
certificate's owner is the one you expect. For more information consult
[`RFC2818']  and section *note ex:verify:: for an example.

5.1.4 PKCS #10 certificate requests
-----------------------------------

A certificate request is a structure, which contain information about
an applicant of a certificate service.  It usually contains a private
key, a distinguished name and secondary data such as a challenge
password. GnuTLS supports the requests defined in PKCS #10 [`RFC2986']
. Other formats of certificate requests are not currently supported.

   * *note gnutls_x509_crq_deinit::

   * *note gnutls_x509_crq_import::

   * *note gnutls_x509_crq_export::

A certificate request can be generated by associating it with a private
key, setting the subject's information and finally self signing it.
The last step ensures that the requester is in possession of the
private key.

The *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_key:: and *note gnutls_x509_crq_sign2::
functions associate the request with a private key and sign it. If a
request is to be signed with a key residing in a PKCS #11 token it is
recommended to use the signing functions shown in *note Abstract key
types::.

   * *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_key::

5.1.5 Certificate revocation lists
----------------------------------

A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a structure issued by an
authority periodically containing a list of revoked certificates serial
numbers.  The CRL structure is signed with the issuing authorities'
keys. A typical CRL contains the fields as shown in *note tab:crl::.
Certificate revocation lists are used to complement the expiration date
of a certificate, in order to account for other reasons of revocation,
such as compromised keys, etc.

   * *note gnutls_x509_crl_export::

A certificate request can be generated by associating it with a private
key, setting the subject's information and finally self signing it.
The last step ensures that the requester is in possession of the
private key. Each CRL is valid for limited amount of time and is
required to provide, except for the current issuing time, also the
issuing time of the next update.

5.1.6 PKCS #12 structures
-------------------------

A PKCS #12 structure [`PKCS12']  usually contains a user's private keys
and certificates. It is commonly used in browsers to export and import
the user's identities.

In GnuTLS the PKCS #12 structures are handled using the
`gnutls_pkcs12_t' type. This is an abstract type that may hold several
`gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t' types.  The bag types are the holders of the
actual data, which may be certificates, private keys or encrypted data.
A bag of type encrypted should be decrypted in order for its data to be
accessed.

   * *note gnutls_pkcs12_init::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs12_deinit::

The following functions are available to read a PKCS #12 structure.

5.2 OpenPGP certificates
========================

The OpenPGP key authentication relies on a distributed trust model,
called the "web of trust". The "web of trust" uses a decentralized
system of trusted introducers, which are the same as a CA. OpenPGP
allows anyone to sign anyone else's public key. When Alice signs Bob's
key, she is introducing Bob's key to anyone who trusts Alice. If
someone trusts Alice to introduce keys, then Alice is a trusted
introducer in the mind of that observer.  For example in *note
fig:openpgp::, David trusts Alice to be an introducer and Alice signed
Bob's key thus Dave trusts Bob's key to be the real one.

 [image src="gnutls-pgp.png" ]

Figure 5.2: An example of the OpenPGP trust model.

There are some key points that are important in that model. In the
example Alice has to sign Bob's key, only if she is sure that the key
belongs to Bob. Otherwise she may also make Dave falsely believe that
this is Bob's key. Dave has also the responsibility to know who to
trust.  This model is similar to real life relations.

Just see how Charlie behaves in the previous example. Although he has
signed Bob's key - because he knows, somehow, that it belongs to Bob -
he does not trust Bob to be an introducer. Charlie decided to trust
only Kevin, for some reason. A reason could be that Bob is lazy enough,
and signs other people's keys without being sure that they belong to
the actual owner.

5.2.1 OpenPGP certificate structure
-----------------------------------

In GnuTLS the OpenPGP key structures [`RFC2440']  are handled using the
`gnutls_openpgp_crt_t' type and the corresponding private keys with the
`gnutls_openpgp_privkey_t' type. All the prototypes for the key
handling functions can be found at `gnutls/openpgp.h'.

5.2.2 Verifying an OpenPGP certificate
--------------------------------------

The verification functions of OpenPGP keys, included in GnuTLS, are
simple ones, and do not use the features of the "web of trust".  For
that reason, if the verification needs are complex, the assistance of
external tools like GnuPG and GPGME(1) is recommended.

In GnuTLS there is a verification function for OpenPGP certificates,
the *note gnutls_openpgp_crt_verify_ring::.  This checks an OpenPGP key
against a given set of public keys (keyring) and returns the key
status. The key verification status is the same as in X.509
certificates, although the meaning and interpretation are different.
For example an OpenPGP key may be valid, if the self signature is ok,
even if no signers were found.  The meaning of verification status
flags is the same as in the X.509 certificates (see *note Table 5.4:
gnutls_certificate_verify_flags.).

   * *note gnutls_openpgp_crt_verify_ring::

   * *note gnutls_openpgp_crt_verify_self::

5.2.3 Verifying a certificate in the context of a TLS session
-------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly with X.509 certificates, one needs to specify the OpenPGP
keyring file in the credentials structure. The certificates in this
file will be  used by *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2:: to
verify the signatures in the certificate sent by the peer.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_file::

5.3 Hardware tokens
===================

5.3.1 Introduction
------------------

This section copes with hardware token support in GnuTLS using PKCS #11
[`PKCS11'] .  PKCS #11 is plugin API allowing applications to access
cryptographic operations on a token, as well as to objects residing on
the token. A token can be a real hardware token such as a smart card
and a trusted platform module (TPM), or it can be a software component
such as Gnome Keyring. The objects residing on such token can be
certificates, public keys, private keys or even plain data or  secret
keys. Of those certificates and public/private key pairs can be used
with GnuTLS. Its main advantage is that it allows operations on private
key objects such as decryption and signing without exposing the key.

A PKCS #11 module to access smart cards is provided by the Opensc(1)
project, and a module to access the TPM chip on a PC is available from
the Trousers(2) project.

Moreover PKCS #11 can be (ab)used to allow all applications in the same
operating system to access shared cryptographic keys and certificates
in a uniform way, as in *note fig:pkcs11-vision::.  That way
applications could load their trusted certificate list, as well as user
certificates from a common PKCS #11 module. Such a provider exists in
the Gnome system, being the Gnome Keyring.

 [image src="pkcs11-vision.png" ]

Figure 5.3: PKCS #11 module usage.

5.3.2 Initialization
--------------------

To allow all the  GnuTLS applications to access PKCS #11 tokens you can
use a configuration per module, stored in `/etc/pkcs11/modules/'.
These are the configuration files of p11-kit(3).  For example a file
that will load the OpenSC module, could be named
`/etc/pkcs11/modules/opensc' and contain the following:

     module: /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so

If you use this file, then there is no need for other initialization in
GnuTLS, except for the PIN and token functions. Those allow retrieving
a PIN when accessing a protected object, such as a private key, as well
as probe the user to insert the token. All the initialization functions
are below.

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_init::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_deinit::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_set_token_function::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_set_pin_function::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_add_provider::

Note that due to limitations of PKCS #11 there are issues when multiple
libraries are sharing a module. To avoid this problem GnuTLS uses
p11-kit that provides a middleware to control access to resources over
the multiple users.

5.3.3 Reading objects
---------------------

All PKCS #11 objects are referenced by GnuTLS functions by URLs as
described in [`PKCS11URI'] .  This allows for a consistent naming of
objects across systems and applications in the same system. For example
a public key on a smart card may be referenced as:

     pkcs11:token=Nikos;serial=307521161601031;model=PKCS%2315; \
     manufacturer=EnterSafe;object=test1;objecttype=public;\
     id=32f153f3e37990b08624141077ca5dec2d15faed

while the smart card itself can be referenced as:
     pkcs11:token=Nikos;serial=307521161601031;model=PKCS%2315;manufacturer=EnterSafe

Objects stored in a PKCS #11 token can be extracted if they are not
marked as sensitive. Usually only private keys are marked as sensitive
and cannot be extracted, while certificates and other data can be
retrieved. The functions that can be used to access objects are shown
below.

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_init::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_deinit::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_import_url::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_export_url::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_export::

   * *note gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11_url::

   * *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import_pkcs11::

Properties of the physical token can also be accessed and altered with
GnuTLS.  For example data in a token can be erased (initialized), PIN
can be altered, etc.

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_init::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_url::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_info::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_flags::

   * *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_set_pin::

example will list all available PKCS #11 tokens in a system and the
latter will list all certificates in a token that have a corresponding
private key.

5.3.4 Writing objects
---------------------

With GnuTLS you can copy existing private keys and certificates to a
token. Note that when copying private keys it is recommended to mark
them as sensitive using the `GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_SENSITIVE' to
prevent its extraction. An object can be marked as private using the
flag `GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_PRIVATE', to require PIN to be
entered before accessing the object (for operations or otherwise).

5.3.5 Using a PKCS #11 token with TLS
-------------------------------------

It is possible to use a PKCS #11 token to a TLS session, as shown in
*note ex:pkcs11-client::. In addition the following functions can be
used to load PKCS #11 key and certificates by specifying a PKCS #11 URL
instead of a filename.

5.4 Abstract key types
======================

Since there are many forms of a public or private keys supported by
GnuTLS such as X.509, OpenPGP, or PKCS #11 it is desirable to allow
common operations on them. For these reasons the abstract
`gnutls_privkey_t' and `gnutls_pubkey_t' were introduced in
`gnutls/abstract.h' header. Those types are initialized using a
specific type of key and then can be used to perform operations in an
abstract way. For example in order to sign an X.509 certificate with a
key that resides in a token the following steps must be used.

     #inlude <gnutls/abstract.h>
     #inlude <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

     void sign_cert( gnutls_x509_crt_t to_be_signed)
     {
     gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t ca_key;
     gnutls_x509_crt_t ca_cert;
     gnutls_privkey_t abs_key;

       /* load the PKCS #11 key and certificates */
       gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_init(&ca_key);
       gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_import_url(ca_key, key_url);

       gnutls_x509_crt_init(&ca_cert);
       gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11_url(&ca_cert, cert_url);

       /* initialize the abstract key */
       gnutls_privkey_init(&abs_key);
       gnutls_privkey_import_pkcs11(abs_key, ca_key);

       /* sign the certificate to be signed */
       gnutls_x509_crt_privkey_sign(to_be_signed, ca_cert, ca_key,
                                    GNUTLS_DIG_SHA256, 0);
     }

5.4.1 Public keys
-----------------

An abstract `gnutls_pubkey_t' can be initialized using the functions
below. It can be imported through an existing structure like
`gnutls_x509_crt_t', or through an ASN.1 encoding of the X.509
`SubjectPublicKeyInfo' sequence.

------------------

An abstract `gnutls_privkey_t' can be initialized using the functions
below. It can be imported through an existing structure like
`gnutls_x509_privkey_t', but unlike public keys it cannot be exported.
That is to allow abstraction over PKCS #11 keys that are not
extractable.

5.5 Digital signatures
======================

In this section we will provide some information about digital
signatures, how they work, and give the rationale for disabling some of
the algorithms used.

Digital signatures work by using somebody's secret key to sign some
arbitrary data.  Then anybody else could use the public key of that
person to verify the signature.  Since the data may be arbitrary it is
not suitable input to a cryptographic digital signature algorithm. For
this reason and also for performance cryptographic hash algorithms are
used to preprocess the input to the signature algorithm. This works as
long as it is difficult enough to generate two different messages with
the same hash algorithm output. In that case the same signature could
be used as a proof for both messages. Nobody wants to sign an innocent
message of donating 1 Euro  to Greenpeace and find out that he donated
1.000.000 Euro  to Bad Inc.

For a hash algorithm to be called cryptographic the following three
requirements must hold:

  1. Preimage resistance.  That means the algorithm must be one way and
     given the output of the hash function H(x), it is impossible to
     calculate x.

  2. 2nd preimage resistance.  That means that given a pair x,y with
     y=H(x) it is impossible to calculate an x' such that y=H(x').

  3. Collision resistance.  That means that it is impossible to
     calculate random x and x' such H(x')=H(x).

The last two requirements in the list are the most important in digital
signatures. These protect against somebody who would like to generate
two messages with the same hash output. When an algorithm is considered
broken usually it means that the Collision resistance of the algorithm
is less than brute force. Using the birthday paradox the brute force
attack takes 2^((hash size) / 2) operations. Today colliding
certificates using the MD5 hash algorithm have been generated as shown
in [`WEGER'] .

There has been cryptographic results for the SHA-1 hash algorithms as
well, although they are not yet critical.  Before 2004, MD5 had a
presumed collision strength of 2^64, but it has been showed to have a
collision strength well under 2^50.  As of November 2005, it is
believed that SHA-1's collision strength is around 2^63.  We consider
this sufficiently hard so that we still support SHA-1.  We anticipate
that SHA-256/386/512 will be used in publicly-distributed certificates
in the future.  When 2^63 can be considered too weak compared to the
computer power available sometime in the future, SHA-1 will be disabled
as well.  The collision attacks on SHA-1 may also get better, given the
new interest in tools for creating them.

5.5.1 Trading security for interoperability
-------------------------------------------

If you connect to a server and use GnuTLS' functions to verify the
certificate chain, and get a `GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM'
validation error (see *note Verifying X.509 certificate paths::), it
means that somewhere in the certificate chain there is a certificate
signed using `RSA-MD2' or `RSA-MD5'.  These two digital signature
algorithms are considered broken, so GnuTLS fails verifying the
certificate.  In some situations, it may be useful to be able to verify
the certificate chain anyway, assuming an attacker did not utilize the
fact that these signatures algorithms are broken.  This section will
give help on how to achieve that.

It is important to know that you do not have to enable any of the flags
discussed here to be able to use trusted root CA certificates
self-signed using `RSA-MD2' or `RSA-MD5'. The certificates in the
trusted list are considered trusted irrespective of the signature.

If you are using *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2:: to verify the
certificate chain, you can call *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags:: with the flags:
   * `GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2'

   * `GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5'
as in the following example:

       gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags (x509cred,
                                            GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5);

This will tell the verifier algorithm to enable `RSA-MD5' when
verifying the certificates.

If you are using *note gnutls_x509_crt_verify:: or *note
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify::, you can pass the
`GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5' parameter directly in the `flags'
parameter.

If you are using these flags, it may also be a good idea to warn the
user when verification failure occur for this reason.  The simplest is
to not use the flags by default, and only fall back to using them after
warning the user.  If you wish to inspect the certificate chain
yourself, you can use *note gnutls_certificate_get_peers:: to extract
the raw server's certificate chain, *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import::
to parse each of the certificates, and then *note
gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature_algorithm:: to find out the signing
algorithm used for each certificate.  If any of the intermediary
certificates are using `GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_MD2' or `GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_MD5',
you could present a warning.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Preparation,  Next: TLS and DTLS sessions,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

6.1 Preparation
===============

To use GnuTLS, you have to perform some changes to your sources and
your build system. The necessary changes are explained in the following
subsections.

* Menu:

* Headers::
* Initialization::
* Version check::
* Building the source::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Headers,  Next: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

6.1.1 Headers
-------------

All the data types and functions of the GnuTLS library are defined in
the header file `gnutls/gnutls.h'.  This must be included in all
programs that make use of the GnuTLS library.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Initialization,  Next: Version check,  Prev: Headers,  Up: Preparation

6.1.2 Initialization
--------------------

GnuTLS must be initialized before it can be used.  The library is
initialized by calling *note gnutls_global_init::.  The resources
allocated by the initialization process can be released if the
application no longer has a need to call GnuTLS functions, this is done
by calling *note gnutls_global_deinit::.

In order to take advantage of the internationalization features in
GnuTLS, such as translated error messages, the application must set the
current locale using `setlocale' before initializing GnuTLS.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Version check,  Next: Building the source,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

6.1.3 Version check
-------------------

It is often desirable to check that the version of `gnutls' used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary compatibility
new features may have been introduced but due to problem with the
dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may want to
check that the version is okay right after program start-up.  See the
function *note gnutls_check_version::.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Building the source,  Prev: Version check,  Up: Preparation

6.1.4 Building the source
-------------------------

If you want to compile a source file including the `gnutls/gnutls.h'
header file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the `-I' option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, the library uses the
external package `pkg-config' that knows the path to the include file
and other configuration options.  The options that need to be added to
the compiler invocation at compile time are output by the `--cflags'
option to `pkg-config gnutls'.  The following example shows how it can
be used at the command line:

     gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags`

Adding the output of `pkg-config gnutls --cflags' to the compilers
command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
`gnutls/gnutls.h' header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search
path (via the `-L' option).  For this, the option `--libs' to
`pkg-config gnutls' can be used.  For convenience, this option also
outputs all other options that are required to link the program with
the library (for instance, the `-ltasn1' option).  The example shows
how to link `foo.o' with the library to a program `foo'.

     gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config gnutls --libs`

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to `pkg-config':

     gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags --libs`


File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS and DTLS sessions,  Next: Priority Strings,  Prev: Preparation,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

6.2 TLS and DTLS sessions
=========================

6.2.1 Session initialization
----------------------------

In the previous sections we have discussed the global initialization
required for GnuTLS as well as the initialization required for each
authentication method's credentials (see *note Authentication
methods::).  In this section we elaborate on the TLS or DTLS session
initiation.  Each session is initialized using *note gnutls_init::
which among others is used to specify the type of the connection
(server or client), and the underlying protocol type, i.e., datagram
(UDP) or reliable (TCP).

   * *note gnutls_init::

After the session initialization details on the allowed ciphersuites
and protocol versions should be set using the priority functions such
as *note gnutls_priority_set_direct::. We elaborate on them in *note
Priority Strings::.  The credentials used for the key exchange method,
such as certificates or usernames and passwords should also be
associated with the session current session using *note
gnutls_credentials_set:: (see *note Authentication methods::).

6.2.2 Setting up the transport layer
------------------------------------

The next step is to setup the underlying transport layer details. The
Berkeley sockets are implicitly used by GnuTLS, thus a call to *note
gnutls_transport_set_ptr2:: would be sufficient to specify the socket
descriptor.

   * *note gnutls_transport_set_ptr2::

   * *note gnutls_transport_set_ptr::

If however another transport layer than TCP is selected, then the
following functions have to be specified.

   * *note gnutls_transport_set_push_function::

   * *note gnutls_transport_set_vec_push_function::

   * *note gnutls_transport_set_pull_function::

The functions above accept a callback function which should return the
number of bytes written, or -1 on error and should set `errno'
appropriately.  In some environments, setting `errno' is unreliable.
For example Windows have several errno variables in different CRTs, or
in other systems it may be a non thread-local variable.  If this is a
concern to you, call *note gnutls_transport_set_errno:: with the
intended errno value instead of setting `errno' directly.

   * *note gnutls_transport_set_errno::

GnuTLS currently only interprets the EINTR and EAGAIN errno values and
returns the corresponding GnuTLS error codes:
   * `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'

   * `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'
The EINTR and EAGAIN values are returned by interrupted system calls,
or when non blocking IO is used.  All GnuTLS functions can be resumed
(called again), if any of the above error codes is returned.

In the case of DTLS it is also desirable to override the generic
transport functions with functions that emulate the operation of
`recvfrom' and `sendto'. In addition DTLS requires timers during the
receive of a handshake message. This requires the *note
gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function:: function to be used.

   * *note gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function::

6.2.3 Handshake
---------------

Once a session has been initialized and a network connection has been
set up, TLS and DTLS protocols perform a handshake. The handshake is
the actual key exchange.

   * *note gnutls_handshake::

The handshake process doesn't ensure the verification of the peer's
identity. When certificates are in use, this can be done, either after
the handshake is complete, or during the handshake if *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function:: has been used. In both cases
the *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2:: function can be used to
verify the peer's certificate (see *note Certificate authentication::
for more information).

   * *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2::

6.2.4 Data transfer and termination
-----------------------------------

Once the handshake is complete and peer's identity has been verified
data can be exchanged. The available functions resemble the POSIX
`recv' and `send' functions. It is suggested to use *note
gnutls_error_is_fatal:: to check whether the error codes returned by
these functions are fatal for the protocol or can be ignored.

   * *note gnutls_record_send::

   * *note gnutls_record_recv::

   * *note gnutls_error_is_fatal::

In DTLS it is adviceable to use the extended receive function shown
below, because it allows the extraction of the sequence number. This is
required in DTLS because messages may arrive out of order.

   * *note gnutls_record_recv_seq::

The *note gnutls_record_check_pending:: helper function is available to
allow checking whether data are available to be read in a GnuTLS session
buffers. Note that this function complements but does not replace
`select()', i.e., *note gnutls_record_check_pending:: reports no data
to be read, `select()' should be called to check for data in the
network buffers.

   * *note gnutls_record_check_pending::

Once a TLS or DTLS session is no longer needed, it is recommended to
use *note gnutls_bye:: to terminate the session. That way the peer is
notified securely about the intention of termination, which allows
distinguishing it from a malicious connection termination.  A session
can be deinitialized with the *note gnutls_deinit:: function.

   * *note gnutls_bye::

   * *note gnutls_deinit::

6.2.5 Asynchronous operation
----------------------------

GnuTLS can be used with asynchronous socket or event-driven programming.
During a TLS protocol session GnuTLS does not block for anything except
calculations. The only blocking operations are due to the transport
layer (sockets) functions.  Those, however, in an asynchronous scenario
are typically set to non-blocking mode, which forces them to return
`EAGAIN' error code instead of blocking.  In that case GnuTLS functions
will return the `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' error code and can be resumed the same
way as a system call would. The only exception is *note
gnutls_record_send::, which if interrupted subsequent calls need not to
include the data to be sent (can be called with NULL argument).

The `select' system call can also be used in combination with the
GnuTLS functions. `select' allows monitoring of sockets and notifies on
them being ready for reading or writing data. Note however that this
system call cannot notify on data present in GnuTLS read buffers, it is
only applicable to the kernel sockets API. Thus if you are using it for
reading from a GnuTLS session, make sure the session is read
completely. That can be achieved by checking there are no data waiting
to be read (using *note gnutls_record_check_pending::), either before
the `select' system call, or after a call to *note
gnutls_record_recv::. GnuTLS does not keep a write buffer, thus when
writing `select' need only to be consulted.

In the DTLS, however, GnuTLS might block due to timers required by the
protocol. To prevent those timers from blocking a DTLS handshake, the
*note gnutls_init:: should be called with the `GNUTLS_NONBLOCK' flag
(see *note TLS and DTLS sessions::).

6.2.6 DTLS sessions
-------------------

Because datagram TLS can operate over connections where the peer of a
server cannot be reliably verified, functionality is available to
prevent denial of service attacks. GnuTLS requires a server to generate
a secret key that is used to sign a cookie(1).  That cookie is sent to
the client using *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_send::, and the client must
reply using the correct cookie. The server side should verify the
initial message sent by client using *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify::.
If successful the session should be initialized and associated with the
cookie using *note gnutls_dtls_prestate_set::, before proceeding to the
handshake.

   * *note gnutls_key_generate::

   * *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_send::

   * *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify::

   * *note gnutls_dtls_prestate_set::

Note that the above apply to server side only and they are not
mandatory to be used. Not using them, however, allows denial of service
attacks.  The client side cookie handling is part of *note
gnutls_handshake::.

Datagrams are typically restricted by a maximum transfer unit (MTU).
For that both client and server side should set the correct maximum
transfer unit for the layer underneath GnuTLS. This will allow proper
fragmentation of DTLS messages and prevent messages from being silently
discarded by the transport layer. The "correct" maximum transfer unit
can be obtained through a path MTU discovery mechanism [`RFC4821'] .

   * *note gnutls_dtls_get_mtu::

   * *note gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu::

6.3 Priority strings
====================

In order to specify cipher suite preferences on a TLS session there are
priority functions that accept a string specifying the enabled for the
handshake algorithms.  That string may contain a high level keyword
such as in *note tab:prio-keywords:: or combination of a high level
keyword, additional algorithm keywords and special keywords.

   * *note gnutls_priority_set_direct::

   * *note gnutls_priority_init::

   * *note gnutls_priority_deinit::

   * *note gnutls_priority_set::

               followed by the algorithms to be enabled.

Table 6.1: Supported priority string keywords.

Unless the first keyword is "NONE" the defaults (in preference order)
are for TLS protocols TLS 1.2, TLS1.1, TLS1.0, SSL3.0; for compression
NULL; for certificate types X.509.  In key exchange algorithms when in
NORMAL or SECURE levels the perfect forward secrecy algorithms take
precedence of the other protocols.  In all cases all the supported key
exchange algorithms  are enabled (except for the RSA-EXPORT which is
only enabled in EXPORT level).  The NONE keyword, if used, must
followed by the algorithms to be enabled, and is used to provide the
exact list of requested algorithms(1). The order with which every
algorithm is specified is significant. Similar algorithms specified
before others will take precedence. The individual algorithms are shown
in *note tab:prio-algorithms:: and special keywords are in *note
tab:prio-special::.  The prefixes for individual algorithms are:
'!' or '-'
     appended with an algorithm will remove this algorithm.

"+"
     appended with an algorithm will add this algorithm.

Keyword                          Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
%COMPAT                           will enable compatibility
                                 mode. It might mean that
                                 violations of the protocols are
                                 allowed as long as maximum
                                 compatibility with problematic
                                 clients and servers is achieved.
%NO_EXTENSIONS                    will prevent the sending of
                                 any TLS extensions in client
                                 side. Note that TLS 1.2
                                 requires extensions to be used,
                                 as well as safe renegotiation
                                 thus this option must be used
                                 with care.
%DISABLE_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION       will disable safe renegotiation
                                 completely.  Do not use unless
                                 you know what you are doing.
                                 Testing purposes only.
%UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION             will allow handshakes and
                                 re-handshakes without the safe
                                 renegotiation extension.  Note
                                 that for clients this mode is
                                 insecure (you may be under
                                 attack), and for servers it
                                 will allow insecure clients to
                                 connect (which could be fooled
                                 by an attacker).  Do not use
                                 unless you know what you are
                                 doing and want maximum
                                 compatibility.
%PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION            will allow initial handshakes
                                 to proceed, but not
                                 re-handshakes.  This leaves the
                                 client vulnerable to attack,
                                 and servers will be compatible
                                 with non-upgraded clients for
                                 initial handshakes.  This is
                                 currently the default for
                                 clients and servers, for
                                 compatibility reasons.
%SAFE_RENEGOTIATION               will enforce safe
                                 renegotiation.  Clients and
                                 servers will refuse to talk to
                                 an insecure peer.  Currently
                                 this causes interoperability
                                 problems, but is required for
                                 full protection.
%SSL3_RECORD_VERSION              will use SSL3.0 record version
                                 in client hello.  This is the
                                 default.
%LATEST_RECORD_VERSION            will use the latest TLS
                                 version record version in
                                 client hello.
%VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5        will allow RSA-MD5 signatures
                                 in certificate chains.
%VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT      will allow V1 CAs in chains.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) To avoid collisions in order to specify a compression algorithm in
this string you have to prefix it with "COMP-", protocol versions with
"VERS-", signature algorithms with "SIGN-" and certificate types with
"CTYPE-". All other algorithms don't need a prefix.

6.4.1 Simple client example with anonymous authentication
---------------------------------------------------------

The simplest client using TLS is the one that doesn't do any
authentication.  This means no external certificates or passwords are
needed to set up the connection.  As could be expected, the connection
is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (active or redirection) attacks.
However, the data is integrity and privacy protected.

6.4.2 Simple client example with X.509 certificate support

with servers that use X.509 or OpenPGP certificate authentication. The
following client is a very simple TLS client, which uses the high level
verification functions for certificates, but does not support session
resumption. The TCP functions defined in this example are used in most

6.7.1 Parameter generation
--------------------------

Several TLS ciphersuites require additional parameters that need to be
generated or provided by the application. The Diffie-Hellman based
ciphersuites (ANON-DH or DHE), require the group parameters to be
provided. Those can either be be generated on the fly using *note
gnutls_dh_params_generate2:: or imported from pregenerated data using
*note gnutls_dh_params_import_pkcs3::.  The parameters can be used in a
TLS session by calling *note gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params:: or
*note gnutls_anon_set_server_dh_params:: for anonymous sessions.

   * *note gnutls_dh_params_init::

   * *note gnutls_dh_params_deinit::

   * *note gnutls_dh_params_generate2::

   * *note gnutls_dh_params_import_pkcs3::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params::

   * *note gnutls_anon_set_server_dh_params::

Due to the time-consuming calculations required for the generation of
Diffie-Hellman parameters we suggest against performing generation of
them within an application. The `certtool' tool can be used to generate
or export known safe values that can be stored in code or in a
configuration file to provide the ability to replace. We also recommend
the usage of *note gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits:: (see *note Selecting
cryptographic key sizes::) to determine the bit size of the generated
parameters.

The ciphersuites that involve the RSA-EXPORT key exchange require
additional parameters. Those ciphersuites are rarely used today because
they are by design insecure, thus if you have no requirement for them,
the rest of this section can be skipped. The RSA-EXPORT key exchange
requires 512-bit RSA keys to be generated. It is recommended those
parameters to be refreshed (regenerated) in short intervals. The
following functions can be used for these parameters.

   * *note gnutls_rsa_params_init::

   * *note gnutls_rsa_params_deinit::

   * *note gnutls_rsa_params_generate2::

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_rsa_export_params::

   * *note gnutls_rsa_params_import_pkcs1::

   * *note gnutls_rsa_params_export_pkcs1::

To allow renewal of the parameters within an application without
accessing the credentials, which are a shared structure, an alternative
interface is available using a callback function.

   * *note gnutls_certificate_set_params_function::

6.7.2 Keying material exporters
-------------------------------

The TLS PRF can be used by other protocols to derive data.  The API to
use is *note gnutls_prf::.  The function needs to be provided with the
label in the parameter `label', and the extra data to mix in the
`extra' parameter.  Depending on whether you want to mix in the client
or server random data first, you can set the `server_random_first'
parameter.

For example, after establishing a TLS session using *note
gnutls_handshake::, you can invoke the TLS PRF with this call:

     #define MYLABEL "EXPORTER-FOO"
     #define MYCONTEXT "some context data"
     char out[32];
     rc = gnutls_prf (session, strlen (MYLABEL), MYLABEL, 0,
                      strlen (MYCONTEXT), MYCONTEXT, 32, out);

If you don't want to mix in the client/server random, there is a more
low-level TLS PRF interface called *note gnutls_prf_raw::.

6.7.3 Channel bindings
----------------------

In user authentication protocols (e.g., EAP or SASL mechanisms) it is
useful to have a unique string that identifies the secure channel that
is used, to bind together the user authentication with the secure
channel.  This can protect against man-in-the-middle attacks in some
situations.  That unique string is called a "channel binding".  For
background and discussion see [`RFC5056'] .

In GnuTLS you can extract a channel binding using the *note
gnutls_session_channel_binding:: function.  Currently only the type
`GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE' is supported, which corresponds to the
`tls-unique' channel binding for TLS defined in [`RFC5929'] .

The following example describes how to print the channel binding data.
Note that it must be run after a successful TLS handshake.

     {
       gnutls_datum_t cb;
       int rc;

       rc = gnutls_session_channel_binding (session,
                                            GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE,
                                            &cb);
       if (rc)
         fprintf (stderr, "Channel binding error: %s\n",
                  gnutls_strerror (rc));
       else
         {
           size_t i;
           printf ("- Channel binding 'tls-unique': ");
           for (i = 0; i < cb.size; i++)
             printf ("%02x", cb.data[i]);
           printf ("\n");
         }
     }

6.7.4 Compatibility with the OpenSSL library
--------------------------------------------

To ease GnuTLS' integration with existing applications, a compatibility
layer with the OpenSSL library is included in the `gnutls-openssl'
library. This compatibility layer is not complete and it is not
intended to completely re-implement the OpenSSL API with GnuTLS.  It
only provides limited source-level compatibility.

The prototypes for the compatibility functions are in the
`gnutls/openssl.h' header file. The limitations imposed by the
compatibility layer include:

   * Error handling is not thread safe.

6.8 Using the cryptographic library
===================================

GnuTLS is not a low-level cryptographic library, i.e., it does not
provide access to basic cryptographic primitives. However it abstracts
the internal cryptographic back-end (see *note Cryptographic Backend::),
providing symmetric crypto, hash and HMAC algorithms, as well access to
the random number generation.

6.8.1 Symmetric cryptography
----------------------------

The available functions to access symmetric crypto algorithms operations
are shown below. The supported algorithms are the algorithms required
by the TLS protocol.  They are listed in *note Table 3.1: tab:ciphers.

   * *note gnutls_cipher_init::

   * *note gnutls_cipher_encrypt2::

   * *note gnutls_cipher_decrypt2::

   * *note gnutls_cipher_set_iv::

   * *note gnutls_cipher_deinit::

In order to support authenticated encryption with associated data
(AEAD) algorithms the following functions are provided to set the
associated data and retrieve the authentication tag.

   * *note gnutls_cipher_add_auth::

   * *note gnutls_cipher_tag::

6.8.2 Hash and HMAC functions
-----------------------------

The available operations to access hash functions and hash-MAC (HMAC)
algorithms are shown below. HMAC algorithms provided keyed hash
functionality. They supported HMAC algorithms are listed in *note Table
3.2: tab:macs.

The available functions to access hash functions are shown below. The
supported hash functions are the same as the HMAC algorithms.

   * *note gnutls_hash_init::

   * *note gnutls_hash::

   * *note gnutls_hash_output::

6.8.3 Random number generation
------------------------------

Access to the random number generator is provided using the *note
gnutls_rnd:: function. It allows obtaining random data of various
levels.

   * GNUTLS_RND_NONCE Non-predictable random number.  Fatal in parts of
     session if broken, i.e., vulnerable to statistical analysis.

   * GNUTLS_RND_RANDOM Pseudo-random cryptographic random number.
     Fatal in session if broken.

   * GNUTLS_RND_KEY Fatal in many sessions if broken.

The program can be used interactively or non interactively by
specifying the `--template' command line option. See below for an
example of a template file.

7.1.1 Diffie-Hellman parameter generation
-----------------------------------------

To generate parameters for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, use the command:
     $ certtool --generate-dh-params --outfile dh.pem

7.1.2 Self-signed certificate generation
----------------------------------------

To create a self signed certificate, use the command:
     $ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem
     $ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem \
        --outfile ca-cert.pem

Note that a self-signed certificate usually belongs to a certificate
authority, that signs other certificates.

7.1.3 Private key generation
----------------------------

To create a private key (RSA by default), run:

     $ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile key.pem

To create a DSA or elliptic curves (ECDSA) private key use the above
command combined with `--dsa' or `--ecc' options.

7.1.4 Certificate generation
----------------------------

To generate a certificate using the private key, use the command:

     $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey key.pem \
        --outfile cert.pem --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem \
        --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem

Alternatively you may create a certificate request, which is needed
when the certificate will be signed by a third party authority.

     $ certtool --generate-request --load-privkey key.pem \
       --outfile request.pem

If the private key is stored in a smart card you can generate a request
by specifying the private key object URL (see *note Invoking p11tool::
on how to obtain the URL).

     $ certtool --generate-request --load-privkey pkcs11:(PRIVKEY URL) \
       --load-pubkey pkcs11:(PUBKEY URL) --outfile request.pem

To generate a certificate using the previous request, use the command:

     $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-request request.pem \
        --outfile cert.pem \
        --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem

7.1.5 Certificate information
-----------------------------

To view the certificate information, use:

     $ certtool --certificate-info --infile cert.pem

7.1.6 PKCS #12 structure generation
-----------------------------------

To generate a PKCS #12 structure using the previous key and
certificate, use the command:

     $ certtool --load-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem \
       --to-p12 --outder --outfile key.p12

Some tools (reportedly web browsers) have problems with that file
because it does not contain the CA certificate for the certificate.  To
work around that problem in the tool, you can use the
-load-ca-certificate parameter as follows:

     $ certtool --load-ca-certificate ca.pem \
       --load-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem \
       --to-p12 --outder --outfile key.p12

7.1.7 Proxy certificate generation
----------------------------------

Proxy certificate can be used to delegate your credential to a
temporary, typically short-lived, certificate.  To create one from the
previously created certificate, first create a temporary key and then
generate a proxy certificate for it, using the commands:

     $ certtool --generate-privkey > proxy-key.pem
     $ certtool --generate-proxy --load-ca-privkey key.pem \
       --load-privkey proxy-key.pem --load-certificate cert.pem \
       --outfile proxy-cert.pem

7.1.8 Certificate revocation list generation
--------------------------------------------

To create an empty Certificate Revocation List (CRL) do:

     $ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
                --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem

To create a CRL that contains some revoked certificates, place the
certificates in a file and use `--load-certificate' as follows:

     $ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
       --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem --load-certificate revoked-certs.pem

To verify a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) do:

     $ certtool --verify-crl --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem < crl.pem

7.1.9 Certtool's template file format:
--------------------------------------

A template file can be used to avoid the interactive questions of
certtool. Initially create a file named 'cert.cfg' that contains the
information about the certificate. The template can be used as below:

     $ certtool --generate-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem  \
        --template cert.cfg \
        --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem

An example certtool template file:

     # X.509 Certificate options
     #
     # DN options

     # The organization of the subject.
     organization = "Koko inc."

     # The organizational unit of the subject.
     unit = "sleeping dept."

     # The locality of the subject.
     # locality =

     # The state of the certificate owner.
     state = "Attiki"

     # The country of the subject. Two letter code.
     country = GR

     # The common name of the certificate owner.
     cn = "Cindy Lauper"

     # A user id of the certificate owner.
     #uid = "clauper"

     # If the supported DN OIDs are not adequate you can set
     # any OID here.
     # For example set the X.520 Title and the X.520 Pseudonym
     # by using OID and string pairs.
     #dn_oid = "2.5.4.12" "Dr." "2.5.4.65" "jackal"

7.2.1 Example client PSK connection
-----------------------------------

To connect to a server using PSK authentication, you need to enable the
choice of PSK by using a cipher priority parameter such as in the
example below.

     $ ./gnutls-cli -p 5556 localhost --pskusername psk_identity \
       --pskkey 88f3824b3e5659f52d00e959bacab954b6540344 \
       --priority NORMAL:-KX-ALL:+ECDHE-PSK:+DHE-PSK:+PSK
     Resolving 'localhost'...
     Connecting to '127.0.0.1:5556'...
     - PSK authentication.
     - Version: TLS1.1
     - Key Exchange: PSK
     - Cipher: AES-128-CBC
     - MAC: SHA1
     - Compression: NULL
     - Handshake was completed

     - Simple Client Mode:

By keeping the `--pskusername' parameter and removing the `--pskkey'
parameter, it will query only for the password during the handshake.

7.4.1 Setting up a test HTTPS server
------------------------------------

Running your own TLS server based on GnuTLS can be useful when
debugging clients and/or GnuTLS itself.  This section describes how to
use `gnutls-serv' as a simple HTTPS server.

The most basic server can be started as:

     gnutls-serv --http

It will only support anonymous ciphersuites, which many TLS clients
refuse to use.

The next step is to add support for X.509.  First we generate a CA:

     $ certtool --generate-privkey > x509-ca-key.pem
     $ echo 'cn = GnuTLS test CA' > ca.tmpl
     $ echo 'ca' >> ca.tmpl
     $ echo 'cert_signing_key' >> ca.tmpl
     $ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
       --template ca.tmpl --outfile x509-ca.pem
     ...

Then generate a server certificate.  Remember to change the dns_name
value to the name of your server host, or skip that command to avoid
the field.

     $ certtool --generate-privkey > x509-server-key.pem
     $ echo 'organization = GnuTLS test server' > server.tmpl
     $ echo 'cn = test.gnutls.org' >> server.tmpl
     $ echo 'tls_www_server' >> server.tmpl
     $ echo 'encryption_key' >> server.tmpl
     $ echo 'signing_key' >> server.tmpl
     $ echo 'dns_name = test.gnutls.org' >> server.tmpl
     $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey x509-server-key.pem \
       --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
       --template server.tmpl --outfile x509-server.pem
     ...

For use in the client, you may want to generate a client certificate as
well.

     $ certtool --generate-privkey > x509-client-key.pem
     $ echo 'cn = GnuTLS test client' > client.tmpl
     $ echo 'tls_www_client' >> client.tmpl
     $ echo 'encryption_key' >> client.tmpl
     $ echo 'signing_key' >> client.tmpl
     $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey x509-client-key.pem \
       --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
       --template client.tmpl --outfile x509-client.pem
     ...

To be able to import the client key/certificate into some applications,
you will need to convert them into a PKCS#12 structure.  This also
encrypts the security sensitive key with a password.

     $ certtool --to-p12 --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem \
       --load-privkey x509-client-key.pem --load-certificate x509-client.pem \
       --outder --outfile x509-client.p12

For icing, we'll create a proxy certificate for the client too.

     $ certtool --generate-privkey > x509-proxy-key.pem
     $ echo 'cn = GnuTLS test client proxy' > proxy.tmpl
     $ certtool --generate-proxy --load-privkey x509-proxy-key.pem \
       --load-ca-certificate x509-client.pem --load-ca-privkey x509-client-key.pem \
       --load-certificate x509-client.pem --template proxy.tmpl \
       --outfile x509-proxy.pem
     ...

Then start the server again:

     $ gnutls-serv --http \
                 --x509cafile x509-ca.pem \
                 --x509keyfile x509-server-key.pem \
                 --x509certfile x509-server.pem

Try connecting to the server using your web browser.  Note that the
server listens to port 5556 by default.

While you are at it, to allow connections using DSA, you can also
create a DSA key and certificate for the server.  These credentials
will be used in the final example below.

     $ certtool --generate-privkey --dsa > x509-server-key-dsa.pem
     $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey x509-server-key-dsa.pem \
       --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
       --template server.tmpl --outfile x509-server-dsa.pem
     ...

The next step is to create OpenPGP credentials for the server.

     gpg --gen-key
     ...enter whatever details you want, use 'test.gnutls.org' as name...

Make a note of the OpenPGP key identifier of the newly generated key,
here it was `5D1D14D8'.  You will need to export the key for GnuTLS to
be able to use it.

     gpg -a --export 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server.txt
     gpg --export 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server.bin
     gpg --export-secret-keys 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server-key.bin
     gpg -a --export-secret-keys 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server-key.txt

Let's start the server with support for OpenPGP credentials:

     gnutls-serv --http \
                 --pgpkeyfile openpgp-server-key.txt \
                 --pgpcertfile openpgp-server.txt

The next step is to add support for SRP authentication. This requires
an SRP password file (see *note Invoking srptool::).  To start the
server with SRP support:

     gnutls-serv --http \
                 --srppasswdconf srp-tpasswd.conf \
                 --srppasswd srp-passwd.txt

Let's also start a server with support for PSK. This would require a
password file created with `psktool' (see *note Invoking psktool::).

     gnutls-serv --http \
                 --pskpasswd psk-passwd.txt

Finally, we start the server with all the earlier parameters and you
get this command:

     gnutls-serv --http \
                 --x509cafile x509-ca.pem \
                 --x509keyfile x509-server-key.pem \
                 --x509certfile x509-server.pem \
                 --x509dsakeyfile x509-server-key-dsa.pem \
                 --x509dsacertfile x509-server-dsa.pem \
                 --pgpkeyfile openpgp-server-key.txt \
                 --pgpcertfile openpgp-server.txt \
                 --srppasswdconf srp-tpasswd.conf \
                 --srppasswd srp-passwd.txt \
                 --pskpasswd psk-passwd.txt

7.6 Invoking srptool
====================

The `srptool' is a very simple program that emulates the programs in
the _Stanford SRP libraries_(1).  It is intended for use in places
where you don't expect SRP authentication to be the used for system
users.

Traditionally _libsrp_ used two files. One called `tpasswd' which holds
usernames and verifiers, and `tpasswd.conf' which holds generators and
primes.

7.6.1 How to use srptool
------------------------

To create tpasswd.conf which holds the g and n values for SRP protocol
(generator and a large prime), run:

     $ srptool --create-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf

This command will create /etc/tpasswd and will add user 'test' (you
will also be prompted for a password).  Verifiers are stored by default
in the way libsrp expects.

     $ srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd \
         --passwd-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf -u test

This command will check against a password.  If the password matches
the one in /etc/tpasswd you will get an ok.

     $ srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd \
         --passwd-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf --verify -u test

7.7 Invoking p11tool
====================

The `p11tool' is a program that helps with accessing tokens and
security modules that support the PKCS #11 API. It requires the
individual PKCS #11 modules to be loaded either with the `--provider'
option, or by setting up the GnuTLS configuration file for PKCS #11 as
in *note Hardware tokens::.

After being provided the available PKCS #11 modules, it can list all
tokens available in your system, the objects on the tokens, and perform
operations on them.

Some examples on how to use p11tool are illustrated in the following
paragraphs.

7.7.1 List all tokens
---------------------

     $ p11tool --list-tokens

7.7.2 List all objects
----------------------

The following command will list all objects in a token. The `--login'
is required to show objects marked as private.
     $ p11tool --login --list-all

7.7.3 Exporting an object
-------------------------

To retrieve an object stored in the card use the following command.
Note however that objects marked as sensitive (typically PKCS #11
private keys) are not allowed to be extracted from the token.
     $ p11tool --login --export pkcs11:(OBJECT URL)

7.7.4 Copy an object to a token
-------------------------------

To copy an object, such as a certificate or private key to a token use
the following command.
     $ p11tool --login --write pkcs11:(TOKEN URL) \
       --load-certificate cert.pem --label "my_cert"

8 Internal Architecture of GnuTLS
*********************************

This chapter is to give a brief description of the way GnuTLS works.
The focus is to give an idea to potential developers and those who want
to know what happens inside the black box.

* Menu:

* The TLS Protocol::
* TLS Handshake Protocol::
* TLS Authentication Methods::
* TLS Extension Handling::
* Cryptographic Backend::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: The TLS Protocol,  Next: TLS Handshake Protocol,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

8.1 The TLS Protocol
====================

The main use case for the TLS protocol is shown in *note
fig:client-server::.  A user of a library implementing the protocol
expects no less than this functionality, i.e., to be able to set
parameters such as the accepted security level, perform a negotiation
with the peer and be able to exchange data.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Handshake Protocol,  Next: TLS Authentication Methods,  Prev: The TLS Protocol,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

8.2 TLS Handshake Protocol
==========================

The GnuTLS handshake protocol is implemented as a state machine that
waits for input or returns immediately when the non-blocking transport
layer functions are used. The main idea is shown in *note
fig:gnutls-handshake::.

 [image src="gnutls-handshake-state.png" ]

Figure 8.2: GnuTLS handshake state machine.

Also the way the input is processed varies per ciphersuite. Several
implementations of the internal handlers are available and *note
gnutls_handshake:: only multiplexes the input to the appropriate
handler. For example a PSK ciphersuite has a different implementation
of the `process_client_key_exchange' than a certificate ciphersuite. We
illustrate the idea in *note fig:gnutls-handshake-sequence::.

8.3 TLS Authentication Methods
==============================

In GnuTLS authentication methods can be implemented quite easily.
Since the required changes to add a new authentication method affect
only the handshake protocol, a simple interface is used. An
authentication method needs to implement the functions shown below.

typedef struct
{
  const char *name;
  int (*gnutls_generate_server_certificate) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st*);
  int (*gnutls_generate_client_certificate) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st*);
  int (*gnutls_generate_server_kx) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st*);
  int (*gnutls_generate_client_kx) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st*);
  int (*gnutls_generate_client_cert_vrfy) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st *);
  int (*gnutls_generate_server_certificate_request) (gnutls_session_t,
                                                     gnutls_buffer_st *);

  int (*gnutls_process_server_certificate) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *,
                                            size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_client_certificate) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *,
                                            size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_server_kx) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *, size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_client_kx) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *, size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_client_cert_vrfy) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *, size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_server_certificate_request) (gnutls_session_t,
                                                    opaque *, size_t);
} mod_auth_st;

Those functions are responsible for the interpretation of the handshake
protocol messages. It is common for such functions to read data from
one or more `credentials_t' structures(1) and write data, such as
certificates, usernames etc. to `auth_info_t' structures.

Simple examples of existing authentication methods can be seen in
`auth/psk.c' for PSK ciphersuites and `auth/srp.c' for SRP
ciphersuites. After implementing these functions the structure holding
its pointers has to be registered in `gnutls_algorithms.c' in the
`_gnutls_kx_algorithms' structure.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Extension Handling,  Next: Cryptographic Backend,  Prev: TLS Authentication Methods,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

8.4 TLS Extension Handling
==========================

As with authentication methods, the TLS extensions handlers can be
implemented using the interface shown below.

typedef int (*gnutls_ext_recv_func) (gnutls_session_t session,
                                     const unsigned char *data, size_t len);
typedef int (*gnutls_ext_send_func) (gnutls_session_t session,
                                     gnutls_buffer_st *extdata);

Here there are two functions, one for receiving the extension data and
one for sending. These functions have to check internally whether they
operate in client or server side.

A simple example of an extension handler can be seen in `ext/srp.c' in
GnuTLS' source code. After implementing these functions, together with
the extension number they handle, they have to be registered using
`_gnutls_ext_register' in `gnutls_extensions.c' typically within
`_gnutls_ext_init'.

8.4.1 Adding a New TLS Extension
--------------------------------

Adding support for a new TLS extension is done from time to time, and
the process to do so is not difficult.  Here are the steps you need to
follow if you wish to do this yourself.  For sake of discussion, let's
consider adding support for the hypothetical TLS extension `foobar'.

8.4.1.1 Add `configure' option like `--enable-foobar' or `--disable-foobar'.
............................................................................

This step is useful when the extension code is large and it might be
desirable to disable the extension under some circumstances. Otherwise
it can be safely skipped.

Whether to chose enable or disable depends on whether you intend to
make the extension be enabled by default.  Look at existing checks
(i.e., SRP, authz) for how to model the code.  For example:

     AC_MSG_CHECKING([whether to disable foobar support])
     AC_ARG_ENABLE(foobar,
     	AS_HELP_STRING([--disable-foobar],
     		[disable foobar support]),
     	ac_enable_foobar=no)
     if test x$ac_enable_foobar != xno; then
      AC_MSG_RESULT(no)
      AC_DEFINE(ENABLE_FOOBAR, 1, [enable foobar])
     else
      ac_full=0
      AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
     fi
     AM_CONDITIONAL(ENABLE_FOOBAR, test "$ac_enable_foobar" != "no")

These lines should go in `lib/m4/hooks.m4'.

8.4.1.2 Add IANA extension value to `extensions_t' in `gnutls_int.h'.
.....................................................................

A good name for the value would be GNUTLS_EXTENSION_FOOBAR.  Check with
`http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values' for
allocated values.  For experiments, you could pick a number but
remember that some consider it a bad idea to deploy such modified
version since it will lead to interoperability problems in the future
when the IANA allocates that number to someone else, or when the foobar
protocol is allocated another number.

8.4.1.3 Add an entry to `_gnutls_extensions' in `gnutls_extensions.c'.
......................................................................

A typical entry would be:

       int ret;

     #if ENABLE_FOOBAR
       ret = _gnutls_ext_register (&foobar_ext);
       if (ret != GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS)
         return ret;
     #endif

Most likely you'll need to add an `#include "ext/foobar.h"', that will
contain something like like:
       extension_entry_st foobar_ext = {
         .name = "FOOBAR",
         .type = GNUTLS_EXTENSION_FOOBAR,
         .parse_type = GNUTLS_EXT_TLS,
         .recv_func = _foobar_recv_params,
         .send_func = _foobar_send_params,
         .pack_func = _foobar_pack,
         .unpack_func = _foobar_unpack,
         .deinit_func = NULL
       }

The GNUTLS_EXTENSION_FOOBAR is the integer value you added to
`gnutls_int.h' earlier.  In this structure you specify the functions to
read the extension from the hello message, the function to send the
reply to, and two more functions to pack and unpack from stored session
data (e.g. when resumming a session). The `deinit' function will be
called to deinitialize the extension's private parameters, if any.

Note that the conditional `ENABLE_FOOBAR' definition should only be
used if step 1 with the `configure' options has taken place.

8.4.1.4 Add new files  that implement the extension.
....................................................

The functions you are responsible to add are those mentioned in the
previous step.  They should be added in a file such as `ext/foobar.c'
and headers should be placed in `ext/foobar.h'.  As a starter, you
could add this:

     int
     _foobar_recv_params (gnutls_session_t session, const opaque * data,
                          size_t data_size)
     {
       return 0;
     }

     int
     _foobar_send_params (gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_buffer_st* data)
     {
       return 0;
     }

     int
     _foobar_pack (extension_priv_data_t epriv, gnutls_buffer_st * ps)
     {
        /* Append the extension's internal state to buffer */
        return 0;
     }

     int
     _foobar_unpack (gnutls_buffer_st * ps, extension_priv_data_t * epriv)
     {
        /* Read the internal state from buffer */
        return 0;
     }

The `_foobar_recv_params' function is responsible for parsing incoming
extension data (both in the client and server).

The `_foobar_send_params' function is responsible for sending extension
data (both in the client and server).

If you receive length fields that doesn't match, return
`GNUTLS_E_UNEXPECTED_PACKET_LENGTH'.  If you receive invalid data,
return `GNUTLS_E_RECEIVED_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER'.  You can use other error
codes from the list in *note Error codes::.  Return 0 on success.

An extension typically stores private information in the `session' data
for later usage. That can be done using the functions
`_gnutls_ext_set_session_data' and `_gnutls_ext_get_session_data'. You
can check simple examples at `ext/max_record.c' and `ext/server_name.c'
extensions.  That private information can be saved and restored across
session resumption if the following functions are set:

The `_foobar_pack' function is responsible for packing internal
extension data to save them in the session resumption storage.

The `_foobar_unpack' function is responsible for restoring session data
from the session resumption storage.

Recall that both the client and server, send and receive parameters,
and your code most likely will need to do different things depending on
which mode it is in.  It may be useful to make this distinction
explicit in the code.  Thus, for example, a better template than above
would be:

     int
     _gnutls_foobar_recv_params (gnutls_session_t session,
                                 const opaque * data,
                                 size_t data_size)
     {
       if (session->security_parameters.entity == GNUTLS_CLIENT)
         return foobar_recv_client (session, data, data_size);
       else
         return foobar_recv_server (session, data, data_size);
     }

     int
     _gnutls_foobar_send_params (gnutls_session_t session,
                                 gnutls_buffer_st * data)
     {
       if (session->security_parameters.entity == GNUTLS_CLIENT)
         return foobar_send_client (session, data);
       else
         return foobar_send_server (session, data);
     }

The functions used would be declared as `static' functions, of the
appropriate prototype, in the same file.  When adding the files, you'll
need to add them to `ext/Makefile.am' as well, for example:

     if ENABLE_FOOBAR
     libgnutls_ext_la_SOURCES += ext/foobar.c ext/foobar.h
     endif

8.4.1.5 Add API functions to enable/disable the extension.
..........................................................

It might be desirable to allow users of the extension to request use of
the extension, or set extension specific data.  This can be implemented
by adding extension specific function calls that can be added to
`includes/gnutls/gnutls.h', as long as the LGPLv3+ applies.  The
implementation of the function should lie in the `ext/foobar.c' file.

To make the API available in the shared library you need to add the
symbol in `lib/libgnutls.map', so that the symbol is exported properly.

When writing GTK-DOC style documentation for your new APIs, don't
forget to add `Since:' tags to indicate the GnuTLS version the API was
introduced in.

8.5 Cryptographic Backend
=========================

Today most new processors, either for embedded or desktop systems
include either instructions  intended to speed up cryptographic
operations, or a co-processor with cryptographic capabilities. Taking
advantage of those is a challenging task for every cryptographic
application or library. Unfortunately the cryptographic library that
GnuTLS is based on takes no advantage of these capabilities. For this
reason GnuTLS handles this internally by following a layered approach
to accessing cryptographic operations as in *note fig:crypto-layers::.

 [image src="gnutls-crypto-layers.png" ]

Figure 8.4: GnuTLS cryptographic back-end design.

The TLS layer uses a cryptographic provider layer, that will in turn
either use the default crypto provider - a software crypto library, or
use an external crypto provider, if available.

8.5.1 Cryptographic library layer
---------------------------------

The Cryptographic library layer, currently supports only libnettle.
Other cryptographic libraries might be supported in the future.

8.5.2 External cryptography provider
------------------------------------

Systems that include a cryptographic co-processor, typically come with
kernel drivers to utilize the operations from software. For this reason
GnuTLS provides a layer where each individual algorithm used can be
replaced by another implementation, i.e., the one provided by the
driver. The FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux kernels(1) include already a
number of hardware assisted implementations, and also provide an
interface to access them, called `/dev/crypto'.  GnuTLS will take
advantage of this interface if compiled with special options. That is
because in most systems where hardware-assisted cryptographic
operations are not available, using this interface might actually harm
performance.

In systems that include cryptographic instructions with the CPU's
instructions set, using the kernel interface will introduce an unneeded
layer. For this reason GnuTLS includes such optimizations found in
popular processors such as the AES-NI or VIA PADLOCK instruction sets.
This is achieved using a mechanism that detects CPU capabilities and
overrides parts of crypto backend at runtime.  The next section
discusses the registration of a detected algorithm optimization. For
more information please consult the GnuTLS source code in
`lib/accelerated/'.

8.5.2.1 Overriding specific algorithms
......................................

When an optimized implementation of a single algorithm is available,
say a hardware assisted version of AES-CBC then the following
(internal) functions, from `crypto-backend.h', can be used to register
those algorithms.

   * `gnutls_crypto_single_cipher_register': To register a cipher
     algorithm.

   * `gnutls_crypto_single_digest_register': To register a hash
     (digest) or MAC algorithm.


Those registration functions will only replace the specified algorithm
and leave the rest of subsystem intact.

8.5.2.2 Overriding the cryptographic library
............................................

In some systems, that might contain a broad acceleration engine, it
might be desirable to override big parts of the cryptographic backend,
or even all of them. T following functions are provided for this reason.

   * `gnutls_crypto_cipher_register': To override the cryptographic
     algorithms backend.

   * `gnutls_crypto_digest_register': To override the digest algorithms
     backend.

   * `gnutls_crypto_rnd_register': To override the random number
     generator backend.

   * `gnutls_crypto_bigint_register': To override the big number number
     operations backend.

   * `gnutls_crypto_pk_register': To override the public key encryption
     backend. This is tied to the big number operations so either none
     or both of them should be overriden.

A.2 Commercial Support
======================

Commercial support is available for users of GnuTLS.  The kind of
support that can be purchased may include:

   * Implement new features.  Such as a new TLS extension.

   * Port GnuTLS to new platforms.  This could include porting to an
     embedded platforms that may need memory or size optimization.

   * Integrating TLS as a security environment in your existing project.

   * System design of components related to TLS.


If you are interested, please write to:

A.3 Bug Reports
===============

If you think you have found a bug in GnuTLS, please investigate it and
report it.

   * Please make sure that the bug is really in GnuTLS, and preferably
     also check that it hasn't already been fixed in the latest version.

   * You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to
     reproduce the bug.

   * You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if
     the results printed are not good and in that case, in what way.
     Make sure that the bug report includes all information you would
     need to fix this kind of bug for someone else.


Please make an effort to produce a self-contained report, with
something definite that can be tested or debugged.  Vague queries or
piecemeal messages are difficult to act on and don't help the
development effort.

If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a
corrected version of the software; if the bug report is poor, we won't
do anything about it (apart from asking you to send better bug reports).

If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright
incorrect, or if the language needs to be improved, please also send a
note.

Send your bug report to:

                         `bug-gnutls@gnu.org'

A.4 Contributing
================

If you want to submit a patch for inclusion - from solving a typo you
discovered, up to adding support for a new feature - you should submit
it as a bug report, using the process in *note Bug Reports::.  There
are some things that you can do to increase the chances for it to be
included in the official package.

Unless your patch is very small (say, under 10 lines) we require that
you assign the copyright of your work to the Free Software Foundation.
This is to protect the freedom of the project.  If you have not already
signed papers, we will send you the necessary information when you
submit your contribution.

For contributions that doesn't consist of actual programming code, the
only guidelines are common sense.  For code contributions, a number of
style guides will help you:

   * Coding Style.  Follow the GNU Standards document.

     If you normally code using another coding standard, there is no
     problem, but you should use `indent' to reformat the code before
     submitting your work.

   * Use the unified diff format `diff -u'.

   * Return errors.  No reason whatsoever should abort the execution of
     the library.  Even memory allocation errors, e.g. when malloc
     return NULL, should work although result in an error code.

   * Design with thread safety in mind.  Don't use global variables.
     Don't even write to per-handle global variables unless the
     documented behaviour of the function you write is to write to the
     per-handle global variable.

   * Avoid using the C math library.  It causes problems for embedded
     implementations, and in most situations it is very easy to avoid
     using it.

   * Document your functions.  Use comments before each function
     headers, that, if properly formatted, are extracted into Texinfo
     manuals and GTK-DOC web pages.

   * Supply a ChangeLog and NEWS entries, where appropriate.

     In case of  the TLS session gets terminated and further receives
     and sends will be disallowed.  If the return value is zero you may
     continue using the underlying transport layer.  sends an alert
     containing a close request and waits for the peer to reply with
     the same message.

     In case of  the TLS session gets terminated and further sends will
     be disallowed. In order to reuse the connection you should wait
     for an EOF from the peer.   sends an alert containing a close
     request.

     Note that not all implementations will properly terminate a TLS
     connection.  Some of them, usually for performance reasons, will
     terminate only the underlying transport layer, and thus not
     distinguishing between a malicious party prematurely terminating
     the connection and normal termination.

     CRED: is a  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function sets a callback to be called in order to retrieve the
     certificate to be used in the handshake.  You are advised to use
     because it is much more efficient in the processing it requires
     from gnutls.

     The callback's function prototype is: int
     (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const gnutls_datum_t* req_ca_dn, int
     nreqs, const gnutls_pk_algorithm_t* pk_algos, int pk_algos_length,

     is only used in X.509 certificates.  Contains a list with the CA
     names that the server considers trusted.  Normally we should send
     a certificate that is signed by one of these CAs. These names are
     DER encoded. To get a more meaningful value use the function .

     contains a list with server's acceptable signature algorithms.
     The certificate returned should support the server's given
     algorithms.

     should contain the certificates and private keys.

     If the callback function is provided then gnutls will call it, in
     the handshake, after the certificate request message has been
     received.

     The callback function should set the certificate list to be sent,
     and return 0 on success. If no certificate was selected then the

     SC: is a  structure.

     This function will delete all the CA name in the given
     credentials. Clients may call this to save some memory since in
     client side the CA names are not used. Servers might want to use
     this function if a large list of trusted CAs is present and
     sending the names of it would just consume bandwidth without
     providing information to client.

     If status is non zero, this function will order gnutls not to send
     the rdnSequence in the certificate request message. That is the
     server will not advertize it's trusted CAs to the peer. If status
     is zero then the default behaviour will take effect, which is to
     advertize the server's trusted CAs.

     application.  This function can be called many times, but will
     only do something the first time.

     Note!  This function is not thread safe.  If two threads call this
     function simultaneously, they can cause a race between checking
     the global counter and incrementing it, causing both threads to
     execute the library initialization code.  That would lead to a
     memory leak.  To handle this, your application could invoke this
     function after aquiring a thread mutex.  To ignore the potential
     memory leak is also an option.

     This function will set the maximum size of all handshake messages.
     Handshakes over this size are rejected with  error code.  The
     default value is 48kb which is typically large enough.  Set this
     to 0 if you do not want to set an upper limit.

     SESSION: is a  structure.

     FUNC: is the function to be called

     This function will set a callback to be called after the client
     hello has been received (callback valid in server side only). This
     allows the server to adjust settings based on received extensions.

     Those settings could be ciphersuites, requesting certificate, or
     anything else except for version negotiation (this is done before
     the hello message is parsed).

     This callback must return 0 on success or a gnutls error code to
     terminate the handshake.

     *Warning:* You should not use this function to terminate the
     handshake based on client input unless you know what you are
     doing. Before the handshake is finished there is no way to know if
     there is a man-in-the-middle attack being performed.

     compression algorithms.

     Enabling the private ciphersuites when talking to other than
     gnutls servers and clients may cause interoperability problems.

     This function will fail if any problem is encountered, and will
     return a negative error code. In case of a client, if the client
     has asked to resume a session, but the server couldn't, then a
     full handshake will be performed.

     The non-fatal errors such as  and  interrupt the handshake
     procedure, which should be later be resumed.  Call this function
     again, until it returns 0; cf.   and .

     If this function is called by a server after a rehandshake request
     then  or  may be returned.  Note that these are non fatal errors,
     only in the specific case of a rehandshake.  Their meaning is that
     the client rejected the rehandshake request or in the case of  it
     might also mean that some data were pending.

     ERR_POS: In case of an error this will have the position in the
     string the error occured

     Sets priorities for the ciphers, key exchange methods, macs and
     compression methods.

     The  option allows you to specify a colon separated list of the
     cipher priorities to enable.  Some keywords are defined to provide
     quick access to common preferences.

     "PERFORMANCE" means all the "secure" ciphersuites are enabled,
     limited to 128 bit ciphers and sorted by terms of speed
     performance.

     "NORMAL" means all "secure" ciphersuites. The 256-bit ciphers are
     included as a fallback only.  The ciphers are sorted by security
     margin.

     "SECURE128" means all "secure" ciphersuites of security level
     128-bit or more.

     "SECURE192" means all "secure" ciphersuites of security level
     192-bit or more.

     "SUITEB128" means all the NSA SuiteB ciphersuites with security
     level of 128.

     "SUITEB192" means all the NSA SuiteB ciphersuites with security
     level of 192.

     "EXPORT" means all ciphersuites are enabled, including the
     low-security 40 bit ciphers.

     "NONE" means nothing is enabled.  This disables even protocols and
     compression methods.

     Special keywords are "!", "-" and "+".  "!" or "-" appended with
     an algorithm will remove this algorithm.  "+" appended with an
     algorithm will add this algorithm.

     Check the GnuTLS manual section "Priority strings" for detailed
     information.

     *Examples:*
     "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+MAC-ALL:+RSA:+AES-128-CBC:+SIGN-ALL:+COMP-NULL"

     "NORMAL:-ARCFOUR-128" means normal ciphers except for ARCFOUR-128.

     "SECURE:-VERS-SSL3.0:+COMP-DEFLATE" means that only secure ciphers
     are enabled, SSL3.0 is disabled, and libz compression enabled.

     "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1",

     "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+ECDHE-RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1:+CURVE-SECP256R1",

     "NORMAL:" is the most compatible mode.

     SESSION: is a  structure.

     This function provides information about the internals of the

     to data, the sequence number of the data.  This is useful in DTLS
     where record packets might be received out-of-order. The returned
     8-byte sequence number is an integer in big-endian format and
     should be treated as a unique message identification.

     DATA: the buffer that the data will be read into

     DATA_SIZE: the number of requested bytes

     This function has the similar semantics with .  The only
     difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different
     error codes.  In the special case that a server requests a
     renegotiation, the client may receive an error code of .  This
     message may be simply ignored, replied with an alert , or replied
     with a new handshake, depending on the client's will.  If  is
     returned by the internal push function (the default is ) then
     will be returned.  If  or  is returned, you must call this
     function again to get the data.  See also .  A server may also
     receive  when a client has initiated a handshake. In that case the
     server can only initiate a handshake or terminate the connection.

     *Returns:* The number of bytes received and zero on EOF (for stream
     connections).  A negative error code is returned in case of an
     error.  The number of bytes received might be less than the
     requested .

     DATA: contains the data to send

     DATA_SIZE: is the length of the data

     This function has the similar semantics with .  The only
     difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different
     error codes.  Note that if the send buffer is full,  will block
     this function.  See the  documentation for full information.  You
     can replace the default push function by using  with a call to
     with a MSG_DONTWAIT flag if blocking is a problem.  If the EINTR
     is returned by the internal push function (the default is ) then
     will be returned. If  or  is returned, you must call this function
     again, with the same parameters; alternatively you could provide a
     pointer for data, and 0 for size. cf. .

     *Returns:* The number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  The
     number of bytes sent might be less than .  The maximum number of
     bytes this function can send in a single call depends on the
     negotiated maximum record size.

gnutls_record_set_max_size
--------------------------

     This function sets the maximum record packet size in this
     connection.  This property can only be set to clients.  The server

     Acceptable values are 512(=2^9), 1024(=2^10), 2048(=2^11) and
     4096(=2^12).  The requested record size does get in effect
     immediately only while sending data. The receive part will take
     effect after a successful handshake.

     This function uses a TLS extension called 'max record size'.  Not
     all TLS implementations use or even understand this extension.

     *Returns:* On success,  (0) is returned, otherwise a negative
     error code is returned.

gnutls_rehandshake
------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_rehandshake (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a  structure.

     This function will renegotiate security parameters with the
     client.  This should only be called in case of a server.

     This message informs the peer that we want to renegotiate
     parameters (perform a handshake).

     If this function succeeds (returns 0), you must call the  function
     in order to negotiate the new parameters.

     Since TLS is full duplex some application data might have been
     sent during peer's processing of this message. In that case one
     should call  until GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE is returned to clear any
     pending data. Care must be taken if rehandshake is mandatory to
     terminate if it does not start after some threshold.

     If the client does not wish to renegotiate parameters he will
     should with an alert message, thus the return code will be  and
     the alert will be .  A client may also choose to ignore this
     message.

     The callback should not return a negative error code the second
     time called, since the handshake procedure will be aborted.

     The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an
     error.

gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials
---------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials

          unsigned int BITS)
     SESSION: is a  structure.

     BITS: is the number of bits

     This function sets the minimum accepted number of bits, for use in
     an SRP key exchange.  If zero, the default 2048 bits will be used.

     In the client side it sets the minimum accepted number of bits.  If
     a server sends a prime with less bits than that  will be returned
     by the handshake.

     This function has no effect in server side.

     *Since:* 2.6.0

     RES: is a  structure.

     PASSWORD_FILE: is the SRP password file (tpasswd)

     PASSWORD_CONF_FILE: is the SRP password conf file (tpasswd.conf)

     This function sets the password files, in a  structure.  Those
     password files hold usernames and verifiers and will be used for
     SRP authentication.

     CRED: is a  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's
     SRP credentials.  The callback's function form is:

     gnutls_datum_t* salt, gnutls_datum_t *verifier, gnutls_datum_t* g,
     gnutls_datum_t* n);

     contains the actual username.  The , ,  and  must be filled in
     using the . For convenience  and may also be one of the static
     parameters defined in gnutls.h.

     In case the callback returned a negative number then gnutls will
     assume that the username does not exist.

     In order to prevent attackers from guessing valid usernames, if a
     user does not exist, g and n values should be filled in using a
     random user's parameters. In that case the callback must return
     the special value (1).

     The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The
     callback function should return 0 on success, while -1 indicates
     an error.

     SALT: should be some randomly generated bytes

     GENERATOR: is the generator of the group

     PRIME: is the group's prime

     RES: where the verifier will be stored.

     This function will create an SRP verifier, as specified in
     RFC2945.  The  and  should be one of the static parameters defined
     in gnutls/gnutls.h or may be generated.

     This function is similar to strerror.  The difference is that it
     accepts an error number returned by a gnutls function; In case of
     an unknown error a descriptive string is sent instead of .

     Error codes are always a negative error code.

     *Returns:* A string explaining the GnuTLS error message.

          SESSION, gnutls_pull_func PULL_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a  structure.

     PULL_FUNC: a callback function similar to

     This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to receive
     data.  Normally, if you use berkeley style sockets, do not need to
     use this function since the default recv(2) will probably be ok.
     The callback should return 0 on connection termination, a positive
     number indicating the number of bytes received, and -1 on error.

     is of the form, ssize_t

     send(2) will probably be ok.  Otherwise you should specify this
     function for gnutls to be able to send data.  The callback should
     return a positive number indicating the bytes sent, and -1 on
     error.

     is of the form, ssize_t
