Breaks:
* show-deps
* buildlock

  Both are based on the same function, and since Depends aren't fully known for
  packages using AddShlibDeps till deb building phase.

  The solution for buildlock is to enforce the policy that all -dev packages
  must have a Depends (RunTimeDepends) on it's -shlibs.

Missing:
* Common code for build, updating and reading the shlibs.db should get merged
* Should move the fink.shlibs files to system.shlibs ie 10.2.shlibs and
  darwin7.shlibs enventually maybe VirtPackages could do this?
* build tests for Shlibs.pm
* Better checking/enforcing of the Shlibs field
* Warning about the Depends field being removed from info files in the future.
* Check for depends on children packages
  This should be easy enough by:
  1) installing all the files and adding a check for the files minus %i + %p
     (installed name) and adding the contents to a hash with the package name in
     it and adding it to the loop.  This should be versioned to = for the most
     part and not read from shlibs.
  2) just read the shlibs fields in the currently build pkgs (current info file)
     and temporarily to the shlibs hash and looped.  (won't be able to use = for
     this version, but much easier to implement)

Documentation:
* AddShlibDeps:
* RunTimeDepends:
* new use of Depends and BuildDepends, where BuildDepends and Depends are
  combined during build phase, and Depends and RunTimeDepends are combined for
  the Dep.  Depends should eventually be discontinued and unsupported and
  should be added as a warning to the validator.  This is to avoid breakage
  while we get everything into BuildDepends for fink build, a pkg should build
  without Depends at all.  AssShlibDeps will auto add all Shared Library
  depends to RunTimeDepends line and will be versioned via Shlibs fields from
  all installed packages.
* Maintainer Mode
