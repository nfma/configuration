 Fink 0.9.0 Installation
=========================

These are the installation instructions for the "source" distribution of
Fink 0.9.0, intended for use with OS X v.10.5 . The instructions can also be
used for installation on OS X v.10.4 (replacing 0.9.0 by 0.8.1 throughout
the document), for installation on OS X v.10.3 (replacing 0.9.0 by 0.7.2
throughout the document), for installation on OS X v.10.2 (replacing 0.9.0
by 0.6.4 throughout the document), and for installation on OS X v.10.1
(replacing 0.9.0 by 0.4.1a).

This document does not apply to the "binary
[http://www.finkproject.org/download/index.php]" distribution.

There are instructions for both first time installation and upgrading from a
previous version. Fast track instructions for the impatient are at the top.


 The Fast Track
================

This section is for the impatient who don't want to take the time to learn
their way around the command line world and don't care that they don't know
what they're actually doing.

If you're looking for the real instructions, skip to the next section. (You
can still use this section as an example.)


 First Time Installation Fast Track
------------------------------------
Start out by copying the "fink-0.9.0-full.tar.gz" file to your home folder.
(Note: If you have OS X 10.4 and XCode 2.1, you should use
"fink-0.8.0-full-XCode-2.1.tar.gz" instead, and make the appropriate changes
below.) Then, open Terminal.app and follow the session below. Computer
output is in "normal face" , your input is in "bold_face" (or otherwise
highlighted). The actual input prompts from the shell may vary, and some
chunks of the output have been omitted ( "..." ).

   [frodo:~] testuser% tar_xzf_fink-0.9.0-full.tar.gz
   [frodo:~] testuser% cd_fink-0.9.0-full
   [frodo:~/fink-0.9.0-full] testuser% ./bootstrap_/sw
   
   Welcome to Fink.
   
   ...
   Choose a method: [1] 1
   
   sudo /Users/testuser/fink-0.9.0-full/bootstrap .sudo '/sw'
   Password:(your_normal_password_here)
   ...
   OK, I'll ask you some questions and update the configuration file in
   '/sw/etc/fink.conf'.
   
   In what additional directory should Fink look for downloaded tarballs? [] (press_return)
   Always print verbose messages? [y/N] (press_return)
   
   Proxy/Firewall settings
   Enter the URL of the HTTP proxy to use, or 'none' for no proxy. The URL
   should start with http:// and may contain username, password or port
   specifications. [none] (press_return)
   Enter the URL of the proxy to use for FTP, or 'none' for no proxy. The URL
   should start with http:// and may contain username, password or port
   specifications. [none] (press_return)
   Use passive mode FTP transfers (to get through a firewall)? [Y/n] y
   
   Mirror selection
   Choose a continent:
   ...
   (enter_the_numbers_corresponding_to_your_location)
   ...
   Writing updated configuration to '/sw/etc/fink.conf'...
   Bootstrapping a base system via /sw/bootstrap.
   ...
   (take_a_coffee_break_while_Fink_downloads_and_compiles_the_base_packages)
   ...
   
   You should now have a working Fink installation in '/sw'.
   
   [frodo:~/fink-0.9.0-full] testuser% cd
   [frodo:~] testuser% rm_-r_fink-0.9.0-full
   [frodo:~] testuser% /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh

The last command runs a little script to help set up your Unix paths (and
other things) for use with Fink. In most cases, it will run automatically,
and prompt you for permission to make changes. If the script fails, you'll
have to do things by hand.

(If you need to do things by hand, and you are using csh or tcsh, you need
to make sure that the command "source /sw/bin/init.csh" is executed during
startup of your shell, either by .login, .cshrc, .tcshrc, or something else
appropriate. If you are using bash or similar shells, the command you need
is ". /sw/bin/init.sh" , and places where it might get executed include
.bashrc and .profile.)

Once you have set up the paths, open a new Terminal.app window, and close
all other ones. That's it, you now have a base system installed.

You can now install additional packages with the "fink" command, like this:

   [frodo:~] testuser% fink_install_xfree86-server_gimp
   sudo /sw/bin/fink 'install' 'xfree86-server' 'gimp'
   Password:(your_normal_password_here)
   Reading package info...
   Information about 147 packages read.
   The following 14 additional packages will be installed:
    audiofile dlcompat esound giflib glib gnome-libs gtk+ imlib libjpeg libpng
    libtiff orbit xfree86-base zlib
   Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y
   ...

If these instructions don't work for you, well, you'll have to take the time
to read through the rest of this document and the online FAQ
[http://www.finkproject.org/faq/]. You can also ask on the fink-users
mailing list [http://www.finkproject.org/lists/fink-users.php], but expect
to be pointed back at the documentation when your problem actually is
well-documented.


 Update Fast Track
-------------------
Start out by copying the "fink-0.9.0-full.tar.gz" file to your home folder.
(Note: If you have OS X 10.4 and XCode 2.1, you should use
"fink-0.8.0-full-XCode-2.1.tar.gz" instead, and make the appropriate changes
below.) Then, open Terminal.app and follow the session below. Computer
output is in "normal face" , your input is in "bold_face" (or otherwise
highlighted). The actual input prompts from the shell may vary, and some
chunks of the output have been omitted ( "..." ).

   [frodo:~] testuser% tar_xzf_fink-0.9.0-full.tar.gz
   [frodo:~] testuser% cd_fink-0.9.0-full
   [frodo:~/fink-0.9.0-full] testuser% ./inject.pl_/sw
   sudo ./inject.pl /sw
   Password:(your_normal_password_here)
   Copying package descriptions
   ...
   Done.
   
   Your Fink installation in '/sw' was updated with new fink packages.
   
   [frodo:~/fink-0.9.0-full] testuser% cd_pkginfo
   [frodo:~/fink-0.9.0-full/pkginfo] testuser% ./inject.pl_/sw
   sudo ./inject.pl /sw
   Copying...
   ...
   
   Your Fink installation in '/sw' was updated with new package description
   files. Use appropriate fink commands to update the packages, e.g. 'fink
   update-all'.
   
   [frodo:~/fink-0.9.0-full/pkginfo] testuser% cd
   [frodo:~] testuser% rm_-r_fink-0.9.0-full
   [frodo:~] testuser% fink_update-all
   ...


 First Time Installation
=========================

 Requirements
--------------
You need:

 * An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.1 or later. Darwin 5.0 and later
   should also work, but this has not been tested. Earlier versions of both
   are not supported and probably will not work.

 * Development tools. On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package from
   the Developer Tools CD. On Darwin, the tools should be present in the
   default install.

 * Many other things that come with Mac OS X and the Developer Tools. This
   includes perl 5.6 and either wget or curl.

 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.

 * Patience. Compiling several big packages takes time. I'm talking hours or
   even days here.


 Choosing A Directory
----------------------
Before you install, you must decide where Fink's directory hierarchy will
live. The recommended place is /sw, and all examples in this document will
use that. Any other directory should be fine as well, as long as you don't
use existing directories like /usr/local or /usr. The bootstrap script tries
to catch these.

If you intend to use the binary distribution (through apt-get / dselect),
you must install to /sw. Unfortunately, binary packages are not relocatable.

The directory that you choose must not contain any spaces or similar. Both
Unix itself and the bulk of Unix software were written under this
assumption. Using symlinks to trick the bootstrap script simply won't work.

A special note about /usr/local: While it is possible to install Fink in
/usr/local (and the bootstrap script will let you do that after a
confirmation), it is a bad idea. Many third party software packages install
into /usr/local. This can cause severe problems for Fink, including
overwriting files, dpkg refusing to install packages and strange build
errors. Also, the /usr/local hierarchy is in the default search path for the
shell and the compiler. That means that it is much more difficult to get
back to a working system when things break. You have been warned.


 Installation
--------------
First, you need to unpack the fink-0.9.0-full.tar.gz tarball. (Note: If you
have OS X 10.4 and XCode 2.1, you should use
"fink-0.8.0-full-XCode-2.1.tar.gz" instead, and make the appropriate changes
below.) It is recommended that you do this from the command line - StuffIt
Expander has a tendency to screw up text files. So, go to the directory
where you put the tarball, and run this command:

   tar xzf fink-0.9.0-full.tar.gz

You now have a directory named fink-0.9.0-full. Change to it with "cd
fink-0.9.0-full" .

The actual installation is performed by the perl script bootstrap. So, to
start installation, go to the fink-0.9.0-full directory and run this
command:

   ./bootstrap

After running some tests, the script will ask you what method should be used
to gain root privileges. The most useful choice is 'sudo'. On a default
install of Mac OS X, sudo is already enabled for the user account created
during installation. The script will immediately use the method you choose
to become root. This is required for the installation.

Next, the script will ask you for the installation path. See 'Choosing A
Directory' above for hints about this. The script will create the directory
and set it up for the bootstrap that will be done later.

Next up is Fink configuration. This consists mainly of setting proxies and
selecting mirror sites for downloading. The process should be
self-explaining. If you don't know what to say, you can just press Return
and Fink will use a reasonable default value.

Finally, the script has enough information to conduct the bootstrap process.
That means it will now download, build and install some essential packages.
Don't worry if you see some packages being compiled twice. This is required
because to build a binary package of the package manager, you first must
have the package manager available.


 Getting X11 Sorted Out
------------------------
Fink uses virtual packages to declare dependencies on X11. As there are
several X11 implementations available for Mac OS X (XFree86, Tenon Xtools,
eXodus) and several ways to install them (manually or via Fink), there are
several actual packages - one for each setup. Fink is quite bad at guessing
what you have, so it's best to get this sorted out right at the beginning.
Here is a list of the available packages and installation methods:

 * xfree86-base: This package is the real thing. It will fetch the XFree86
   source, compile it and install it into /usr/X11R6. For maximum
   flexibility, this package does not contain the actual XDarwin server. To
   get it, you can install the xfree86-server package. Or you can install it
   manually, for example using an "XDarwin" test release from the XonX
   project or one of the "rootless" servers circulating the net.

 * system-xfree86: This package expects that you installed XFree86 manually,
   either from source or from the official binary distribution. It will just
   check that the installation is useful and then act as a dependency
   placeholder. Note that XFree86 4.0.2 or 4.0.3 will not pass the test. You
   need a version that builds shared libraries. Usually that will be 4.1.0,
   but CVS versions not older than a few months will also work.

 * system-xtools: Install this package if you have Tenon's Xtools product
   installed. Like system-xfree86, this will just do a sanity check and
   leave the actual files alone.

For more information on installing and running X11, refer to the online X11
on Darwin and Mac OS X document [http://www.finkproject.org/doc/x11/].


 Upgrading From Fink 0.3.x
===========================

If you already have Fink 0.3.x installed, you can update your installation
to 0.9.0 with the built-in 'selfupdate' command.


 Updating The Package Manager
------------------------------
To update Fink, run the following command:

   fink selfupdate

This will automatically update your existing Fink installation to use the
latest package manager, and also update all essential packages. However, it
will not update any other packages.


 Getting tetex Sorted Out
--------------------------
If you are upgrading from a Fink release prior to 0.3.1, and you have tetex
installed, you should run the command "fink remove tetex" before upgrading.
(It may also be necessary to remove the packages which depend on tetex, such
as lyx, before tetex can be removed.) Afterwards you can again install tetex
and the other packages you removed.


 Updating Packages
-------------------
The above updating steps will not update the actual packages, they only
provide you with the means to do so. The easiest way to get the new packages
is to use the 'update-all' command:

   fink update-all

This will bring all installed packages to the latest version. If you don't
want to do this (it may take some time), you can update individual packages
with the 'update' command.


 Upgrading From Fink 0.2.x
===========================

If you already have Fink 0.2.x installed, you can update your installation
to 0.9.0 with this package.

Actually, there are two pieces that are updated independently: the package
manager and the package descriptions. It is recommended to update the
package manager first.


 Updating The Package Manager
------------------------------
To update the package manager, run the inject.pl script in the
fink-0.9.0-full directory, like this:

   ./inject.pl

It will try to locate your Fink installation automatically. If it can't find
it, you can pass the path as a parameter, like this:

   ./inject.pl /sw

The script copies the package descriptions into the appropriate directory,
creates tarballs in /sw/src and then runs fink to install the new versions
of the fink and base-files packages. (Yes, that means that fink updates
itself. ":-)" )


 Updating The Package Descriptions
-----------------------------------
If you downloaded the fink-0.9.0-full tarball, the package descriptions are
in the subdirectory pkginfo. To install them, run the inject.pl script in
that directory:

   cd pkginfo
   ./inject.pl

This inject.pl script works just like the one for the package manager.

You can also grab the package descriptions as a separate tarball,
packages-0.9.0. If you did that, just unpack it and run the inject.pl script
inside.

As a third alternative, you can have Fink automatically update itself to the
latest set of package descriptions by issuing the following command:

   fink selfupdate


 Getting X11 Sorted Out
------------------------
The first thing you should do after updating the package descriptions is
getting the X11 dependencies settled (unless you already did that after
upgrading to 0.2.3). Refer to the "Getting X11 Sorted Out" section under
"First Time Installation" above.


 Updating Packages
-------------------
The above updating steps will not update the actual packages, they only
provide you with the means to do so. The easiest way to get the new packages
is to use the 'update-all' command:

   fink update-all

This will bring all installed packages to the latest version. If you don't
want to do this (it may take some time), you can update individual packages
with the 'update' command.


 Other Notes
-------------
IMPORTANT! When you update from Fink 0.2.0 or a CVS version before 0.2.1,
the first thing you should do after running the inject.pl scripts is this:

   fink update dpkg

There was a bug in dpkg that could lead to partially extracted packages. If
you had unusual trouble with installed packages, especially missing
symlinks, use 'fink reinstall' on them to re-install the .deb package files.


 Upgrading From Fink 0.1.x
===========================

 Clean cut
-----------
There is no direct upgrade path from Fink 0.1.x to Fink 0.2.x, because they
use different methods for underlying package management (stow vs. dpkg). The
only way to upgrade is to do a complete reinstall. The procedure is as
follows:

 * Save any changes you have made to configuration files etc.

 * Save a list of packages you had installed. Hint: Try "ls
   /sw/var/fink-stamp" .

 * If you have the source tarballs still lying around in /sw/src and don't
   want to download them again, move them to another directory.

 * Wipe out the /sw directory, i.e. "cd / ; rm -rf /sw" . Do this as root if
   necessary.

 * Follow the procedures for a first time installation above.

 * When you're asked for an 'additional directory for downloaded tarballs',
   enter the directory you moved the tarballs to.

 * Reinstall the packages you need.
